messagedetail300037=A connect exception was encountered while creating a socket to the NodeManager.
cause300037=The NodeManager is not running.
action300037=Start the NodeManager and rerun the command.
messagedetail300040=An I/O error occurred while attempting to write a NodeManager status change message to the standard output stream. While the server will continue to run, this will prevent the NodeManager from being able to continue monitoring the server properly.
cause300040=Possible causes are that the standard output stream has been closed or the NodeManager stopped monitoring.
action300040=If this server requires monitoring, restart the server.
severity300043=16
messagedetail300043=Could not load the NodeManager native library or it is not available on this platform. As a result, the current server process ID will not be saved and the NodeManager will be unable to kill this server.
cause300043=The NodeManager native library is not in the library search path or is unavailable on this platform.
action300043=Ensure that the NodeManager native library is available and in the library search path.
messagedetail300044=An I/O exception occurred while writing the current server process ID to the server PID file. As a result, the current server process ID will not be saved and the NodeManager will be unable to kill this server.
cause300044=The server PID file might be write-protected.
action300044=Ensure that the server PID file is not write-protected. In addition, check to see if the parent directory exists (should have been created by the NodeManager server before starting the server).
severity300047=128
messagedetail300047=Uncatalogued debug message - please do not change.
cause300047=Debugging - please do not change.
action300047=No action required.
messagedetail300048=An I/O error occurred while attempting to start the specified server.
cause300048=The most likely cause is a configuration error in the Shell/SSH/RSH NodeManager configuration.
action300048=Ensure that you can access the remote NodeManager. This may require setting up SSH permissions for the SSH-based NodeManager. In addition, ensure that the default PATH settings for the remote NodeManager are correct. See the NodeManager documentation for more information.
messagedetail300049=An I/O exception occurred while writing the current server default URL to the server URL file. As a result the current server default URL will not be saved. The NodeManager uses the contents of this file on restart in conjunction with the PID file. After checking the existence of the process using the PID stored in the PID file, the NodeManager will try to communicate to the server using the default URL to make sure that the process is indeed the WebLogic Server instance. Without this file, NodeManager will not be able to perform the second check.
cause300049=The server URL file might be write-protected.
action300049=Ensure that the server URL file is not write-protected. In addition, check to see if the parent directory exists (it should have been created by the NodeManager server before starting the server).
messagedetail300051=An I/O error occurred while updating the startup properties for "{0}". This probably occurred because the NodeManager is unreachable. This could mean that the servers boot.properties or startup.properties file is out of date, and the next time NodeManager attempts to automatically restart the server on a failure, it will use out of date properties. To resolve this issue, either ensure that the NodeManager is able to receive the updates and reset the properties, or restart the server.
cause300051=An I/O error occurred while updating the startup properties for "{0}". This probably occured because the NodeManager is unreachable.
action300051=Either ensure that the NodeManager is able to receive the updates and reset the properties, or restart the server.
messagedetail300053=A migratable server was not found to contain any specified IP address in the ServerMBean or custom network channels for migration. No IPs will be passed to NodeManager and no IPs will be migrated. The server may not start without an available address, or may not be accessible throughout migration without a consistent IP.Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.

No IPs will be passed to NodeManager and no IPs will be migrated. The server may not start without an available address, or may not be accessible throughout migration without a consistent IP.
action300053=Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
messagedetail300054=Could not find appropriate IP for ListenAddress "{0}" specified for a migratable server. Reason: "{1}". The NodeManager may not be able to bind the specified address and the server may not start without the available address. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
cause300054=No appropriate IP was found for a migratable server's listen address. The NodeManager may not be able to bind the address specified and the server may not start without the available address. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
action300054=Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
