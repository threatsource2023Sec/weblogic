300037=The NodeManager at host {0} and port {1} seems to be down. Start the NodeManager and rerun the command.
300040=An I/O error occurred while writing a NodeManager status change message.
300043=NodeManager native library not found - server process ID not saved.
300044=An I/O error occurred while writing the server PID file: "{0}".
300047={0}
300048=Unable to start the server {0} : {1}
300049=An I/O error occurred while writing the server URL file: "{0}".
300051=An I/O error occurred while updating the startup properties for "{0}". This probably occurred because the NodeManager is unreachable. This could mean that the servers boot.properties or startup.properties file is out of date, and the next time NodeManager attempts to automatically restart the server on a failure, it will use out of date properties. To resolve this issue, either ensure that the NodeManager is able to receive the updates and reset the properties, or restart the server.
300053=A migratable server was not found to contain any specified IP address in the ServerMBean or custom network channels for migration. No IPs will be passed to NodeManager and no IPs will be migrated. The server may not start without an available address, or may not be accessible throughout migration without a consistent IP. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
300054=Could not find appropriate IP for ListenAddress "{0}" specified for a migratable server. Reason: "{1}". The NodeManager may not be able to bind the specified address and the server may not start without the available address. Configure an appropriate floating listen address for the server.
300055=The NodeManagerMonitor add requires a non-null MachineMBean to monitor the active status of a NodeManager.
300056=Could not execute the native output file rotation logic due to "{0}".
300057=Starting server {0} on machine {2} at {1}
300058=Starting server {0} on machine at {1}
