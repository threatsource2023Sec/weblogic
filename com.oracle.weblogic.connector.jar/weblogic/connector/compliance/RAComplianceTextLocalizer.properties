ELEMENT_IS_EMPTY=The {0} element {1} is empty.
MUST_IMPLEMENT_INTERFACE=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], must implement {3} but does not.
MISSING_RA_BEAN=A <jndi-name> is specified for the resource adapter bean in weblogic-ra.xml, however no <resourceadapter-class> element is specified in ra.xml
SHOULD_NOT_OVERRIDE=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], should not override either equals() or hashCode(), but does. This is fine as long as the Java object identity is preserved.
ZERO_LENGTH_NAME=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], is of length zero.
CLASS_NOT_FOUND=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], was not found in the resource adapter archive/application.
COULDNT_LOAD_CLASS=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], could not be loaded from the resource adapter archive/application because of the following error: {3}
MUST_OVERRIDE=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], must override both equals() and hashCode(), but does not.
SHOULD_IMPLEMENT_INTERFACE=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], should implement {3} but does not.
FILE_NOT_FOUND=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], was not found in the resource adapter archive/application.
NOT_A_JAVA_BEAN=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], is not a JavaBean as indicated by the following error: ''{3}''
MISSING_JNDI_NAME=This is an inbound resource adapter which defines one or more inbound message listeners and a resource adapter bean in its ra.xml. Since the weblogic-ra.xml does not, however, specify a JNDI name for the resource adapter bean, it will not be possible for message endpoints (MDBs) to be connected to this resource adapter.
MISSING_RA_BEAN_FOR_INBOUND=This resource adapter specifies one or more inbound message listeners in its ra.xml. Since it does not, however, specify a resource adapter bean, it will not operate as an inbound resource adapter.
MISSING_RA_XML=This resource adapter does not have an ra.xml.
NO_MATCHING_ADMIN_INTERFACE=The weblogic-ra.xml <adimin-object-interface> ''{0}'' does not match any <adminobject-interface> in the ra.xml.
NO_MATCHING_CONN_FACTORY_INTERFACE=The weblogic-ra.xml <connection-factory-interface> ''{0}'' does not have any matching <connectionfactory-interface> in ra.xml.
DUPLICATE_RA_PROPERTY=The ra.xml element {0} contains duplicated property names: "{1}". These properties will be ignored.
DUPLICATE_WLRA_PROPERTY=The webloig-ra.xml or plan.xml element {0} contains duplicated property names: "{1}". These properties will be ignored.
DUPLICATE_RA_PROPERTY_MULTI_TYPES=The ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" of type "{2}" and value "{3}" which duplicates a property of the same name but with type "{4}". You will not be able to override this default value in weblogic-ra.xml.
MISSING_RA_PROPERTY=The weblogic-ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" with value "{2}", but this property is not a writeable property of the ResourceAdapter class or cannot be found in ra.xml.
MISSING_CF_PROPERTY=The weblogic-ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" with value "{2}" for the ManagedConnectionFactory class "{3}", but this property is not defined in ra.xml (for JCA 1.5 adapter), or is not a writeable property of this ManagedConnectionFactory class (for JCA 1.6 adapter).
MISSING_AO_PROPERTY=The weblogic-ra.xml element {0} contains a property "{1}" with value "{2}" for the admin object class "{4}", interface "{3}". But this property is not defined in ra.xml (for JCA 1.5 adapter), or is not a writeable property of the admin object class (for JCA 1.6 adapter).
NULL_PROPERTY_NAME=The ra.xml element {0} contains a property of type "{1}" and value "{2}" whose name is blank.
PROPERTY_TYPE_VALUE_MISMATCH=The {0} element {1} has a property with name "{2}", and the value "{4}" which does not match type "{3}", and will result in the following exception when set: "{5}"
INVALID_PROPERTY_TYPE(=In {0} element {1} the property named "{2}" has an invalid type "{3}"
NO_SET_METHOD_FOR_PROPERTY=In {0} element {1}, the property "{2}" of type "{3}": unable to find a set method in class "{4}".
PROPERTY_TYEPE_MISMATCH=In {0} element {1}, for property "{2}" of type "{3}" and value "{4}", the type in the descriptor does not match the type in the class: "{5}".
NULL_PROPERTYDESCRIPTOR_TYPE=In {0} element {1} for property name "{2}" of type "{3}" found property named "{4}" in class {5} for which we could not obtain the property type.
MUST_SPECIFY_ADAPTERBEN_INDD=There is more than one class annotated with @javax.resource.Connector "{0}". You must specify one as resourceadapter-class in ra.xml
CONFIGPROPERTY_NOT_VALID_TYPE={2} is not a valid config property type; ConfigProperty annotation on class "{0}" {1} will be ignored.
CONFIGPROPERTY_NOT_VALID_TYPE_MATCH=ConfigProperty type on class "{0}" "{1}" does not equal the corresponding JavaBean property type.
CONFIGPROPERTY_FEILD_IS_NOT_PROPERTY=Field "{1}" on class "{0}" is not a valid JavaBean property. ConfigProperty annotation on it is not allowed. Verify that there are correct getter and setter methods defined for this property.
CONFIGPROPERTY_NOT_VALID_SETTER_METHOD=Method "{1}" on class "{0}" is not a valid JavaBean setter method: the setter method must be named as setXXX, must have exactly one parameter, and the return type must be void. ConfigProperty annotation on it is not allowed. Verify that the annotation is on the correct setter method.
CONFIGPROPERTY_NOT_VALID_SETTER_NO_PROPERTY_FOUND=Method "{1}" on class "{0}" is expected to map to property name "{2}" according to JavaBean rules, but there is no such property defined on this class. ConfigProperty annotation on it is not allowed. Verify that there are correct getter and setter methods defined for this property.
CANT_DETERMINE_ADMIN_INTERFACE=AdaminObject "{0}" implements more than one interfaces. You must state only one in theadminObjectInterfaces annotation element or ra.xml.
CONNECTOR_MUST_ON_ADATERBEN=Class "{0}" must implement interface javax.resource.spi.ResourceAdapter because it is annotated with @javax.resource.Connector.
CONNECTION_MUST_ON_MCF=Class "{0}" must implement interface javax.resource.spi.ManagedConnectionFactory because it is annotated with @javax.resource.ConnectionDefinition.
requiredWorkContexts_ClassNotFound=Cannot load class "{0}", exception is "{1}"
requiredWorkContexts_NotImplementWorkContext=Class "{0}" must implement the javax.resource.spi.work.WorkContext interface.
requiredWorkContexts_NotSupported=WorkContext "{0}" is not supported.
adminObjectInterfaceNotUnique=More than one admin object implements interface "{0}". <admin-object-class> must be specified in admin-object-group in weblogic-ra.xml.
noMatchingAdminInterfaceAndClass=The weblogic-ra.xml <adimin-object-interface> ''{0}'' <adimin-object-class> ''{1}'' does not match any <adminobject> in the ra.xml.
INVALID_ANNOTATION_TYPE=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], cannot contain an annotation that is of type ''{3}''.
INVALID_ANNOTATION=The class ''{2}'', which is defined as [{1}] from [{0}], cannot be annotated with ''{3}''.
principalNameNotEmpty=The principal name defined for the tag <{0}> in the weblogic-ra.xml must contain at least one non-space alphabetic character.
noJNDINameForAdminObjectInstance=The weblogic-ra.xml <adimin-object-interface> ''{0}'' <adimin-object-class> ''{1}'' contains an admin-object-instance subelement that does not define a valid jndi-name value.
noJNDINameForConnectionInstance=The weblogic-ra.xml <connection-definition-group> ''{0}'' contains a connection-instance sub-element that does not define valid jndi-name value.
