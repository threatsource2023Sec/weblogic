2194501=Failed to initialize a Coherence cluster due to {0}
2194502=Shutting down a Coherence cluster scoped to classloader {0}
2194503=Failed to shut down a Coherence cluster due to {0}
2194504=Deployed a GAR ({0}) without a CoherenceClusterSystemResourceMBean definition on this server. In most of the scenarios, a Coherence cluster must be created for applications to work properly.
2194505=Server {0} is configured with 'localhost' as the Unicast Listen Address. A generated Coherence WKA list will not operate correctly across multiple machines. This will result in an error if Coherence is run in Production mode.
2194506=Could not find the JNDI resource [{0}] referenced by {1}.
2194507=The Coherence cluster service failed to start or failed to join cluster due to {0} using {1}.
2194508=Coherence configuration failed due to {0} using {1}.
2194509=The WeblogicCoherenceBean and CoherenceClusterParamsBean are not defined for the CoherenceClusterSystemResourceMBean {0}.
2194510=While configuring the Coherence Cluster Service, the Server MBean or Server CoherenceMemberConfig MBean or both were not defined.
2194511=Server {0} is configured with 'localhost' as the Unicast Listen Address which is an error in Coherence Production mode. A generated Coherence WKA list will not operate correctly across multiple machines.
2194512=While undeploying a GAR, the deployment module received an exception when closing files {0}.
2194513=Deployed an application ({0}) with Coherence*Web as session persistence type without a CoherenceClusterSystemResourceMBean definition on this server. Typically, a Coherence cluster must be created for this scenario to work properly.
2194514=There was an error creating Timer Manager for the Managed Server Level Coherence*Web Session Reaping Manager.
2194515=There was an error during the Session Reaping process of the Coherence*Web Session Reaping Manager.
