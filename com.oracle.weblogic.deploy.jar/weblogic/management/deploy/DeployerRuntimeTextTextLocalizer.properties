README_CONTENT=* This directory contains internal files used by the deployment system. \n\n* Contents of this directory should never be removed while the \ncorresponding server is running. \n\n* Removing sub-directories when the server is down will slow down the \nsubsequent deployment of the corresponding applications because these \nsub-directories need to be created again. \n\n* The individual sub-directories are removed when the corresponding \napplication is undeployed.
