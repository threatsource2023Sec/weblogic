cause149202=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149202=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then re-initiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149205=The targeted server was unable to initialize the application because the application container encountered an error.
cause149205=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.

severity149239=16
stack149239=false
messagedetail149239=The Administration Server is part of a cluster. Normally, deployment failures during startup of cluster members result in an aborted startup. Since this is the Administration Server, it is allowed to continue. It must be noted that the cluster is now in an inconsistent state, which could result in failed service requests.
cause149239=One or more applications could not be deployed during the startup of the Administration Server.
action149239=Oracle recommends that the Administration Server not be part of a cluster. One response to this warning is to remove it from the cluster and restart the Administration Server. Alternatively, review the Administration Server log to understand why the deployment failed, fix the problem, and redeploy the application.
severity149243=16
messagedetail149243=A problem occurred while deploying the internal application "{0}".
cause149243=It is likely that the internal staged directory was corrupt or there was a failure when deploying the staged application.
action149243=No action is necessary if the retry succeeds. Otherwise, the nature of the failure should provide an indication of the problem and its resolution. If this is not clear, contact My Oracle Support with the relevant logs and configuration files.
messagedetail149245=The document in question is not a deployment plan.
cause149245=The application is configured with an incorrect deployment plan document.
action149245=Deploy the application using a valid deployment plan.
messagedetail149246=The security realm "{0}" does not support application versioning. The deployment of the application version failed.
cause149246=The security realm "{0}" does not support application versioning. The deployment of the application version failed.
action149246=Deploy the application using a security realm that supports application versioning.
messagedetail149247=The targeted server was unable to transition the application to running mode because the application container encountered an error.
cause149247=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.
action149247=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149248=The targeted server was unable to transition the application to administration mode because the application container encountered an error.
cause149248=The cause of this error is likely in the application or the application subsystem for that application type.

cause149250=This was an unexpected error.
action149250=Report this error to My Oracle Support.
severity149251=16
messagedetail149251=This is informational, because the container will be moved to the intended state, regardless of the error.
cause149251=See the exception in the message body.
action149251=Typically, no action is required.
severity149252=16
messagedetail149252=The operation will have no effect.
cause149252=See the message body.
action149252=No action is required.
messagedetail149256=The targeted server was unable to find deployment for the application "{0}".
cause149256=The cause of this error is likely that the deployment was not properly created, possibly because it may not have proper descriptors.
action149256=Review the exception and attempt to repair the application level. Then reinitiate the deployment request.
messagedetail149257=Applications and shared libraries must be stopped prior to redistributing.
cause149257=The application or shared library was not stopped or had pending updates.
action149257=Verify that the application or shared library is stopped or has no pending updates before attempting to distribute it. You may also consider redeploying the application.
severity149258=16
messagedetail149258=The server failed to completely remove the staged files "{1}" for application "{0}". Check the directory and ensure that no other application is using this directory. This will result in inappropriate results when this server is partitioned and tries to deploy this application.
cause149258=Another application might be using the files under a staging directory.
action149258=Delete the appropriate staged files manually.
severity149259=1
messagedetail149259=Clustered servers must successfully deploy all configured applications in order to complete the startup process. Startup failure of any configured deployments will cause the server to be brought up in the administration state instead.
cause149259=This problem occurred due to failed deployments, which are already logged.
action149259=Correct the cause of the deployment errors, redeploy the failed deployments, and resume or restart the server in the cluster.
messagedetail149260=A failure occurred during application startup.
cause149260=Check the error stack trace for details of the failure.
action149260=Correct the cause of the application failure, if possible, and redeploy the application or restart the server. If it is an Oracle internal application, report it to My Oracle Support.

cause149265=See the reported error in the message body.
action149265=Start the application.
messagedetail149266=Illegal state for operation deploy: "{0}".

action149266=Verify that the specified application name and operation are correct.
messagedetail149267=Cancel operation on deployment task "{0}" on server "{1}" failed.
cause149267=See the underlying exception.
action149267=Take action based on the underlying exception.
messagedetail149268=Application "{0}" is non-versioned and its manifest file defines a version. Modifying the manifest file with a version for non-versioned applications is not supported under static deployment.
