USAGE_VERBOSE=Displays additional status during the deployment process, including notifications when the application is prepared and activated on each target.
USAGE_DEBUG=[option] Displays debug level messages to the standard output.
USAGE_DEFAULT_TARGETS=[option] indicates that targeting for any JMS submodules should be derived by the system. This is the default behavior.
USAGE_USE_NONEXCLUSIVE_LOCK=[option] Used to indicate the deployment operation will utilize an existing lock on the domain already acquired by the same user. This is useful when the user is employing multiple deployment tools simultaneously and one of them has acquired a lock on the domain configuration.
USAGE_NO_DEFAULT_TARGETS=[option] indicates that targeting for any JMS submodules should not be derived by the system
USAGE_EXAMPLES=[option] Displays example usage of this tool.

USAGE_ENFORCE_CLUSTER_CONSTRAINTS=[deprecated option] Enabling this flag results in the enforcement of strict cluster constraints during deployment. This means that all servers that are part of the cluster need to be running before deployment will proceed. Using the default value of ''false'' for this flag results in deployments to clusters not requiring all servers to be active. Active servers in the cluster will receive the deployment immediately. A server(s) in the cluster that is shutdown or inactive will receive the deployment on a restart. A server(s) that is temporarily partitioned will receive the deployment shortly after rejoining the cluster. Application requests arriving on this server(s) in the window between rejoining the cluster and the server(s) catching up on pending deployments will fail. These failures are temporary and will go away once the server(s) has had the opportunity to catch up to the latest deployments. This will usually occur within a couple of minutes.
