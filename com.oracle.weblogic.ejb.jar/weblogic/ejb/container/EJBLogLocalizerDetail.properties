messagedetail014003=EJB {0} uses optimistic concurrency and contains a finder or select method, {1}, for which include-updates is true. This combination of features does not work properly with database {2}.
cause014003=Optimistic concurrency is implemented by reading data in a local transaction to avoid holding database locks, unless Oracle is used as the database. Oracle read consistency does not hold read locks, so in this case reads are performed using the current JTA transaction. When reads are performed in a local transaction updates that have been flushed prior to commit of the transaction are not visible.

cause014011=Optimistic concurrency is implemented by reading data in a local transaction to avoid holding database locks. The element use-select-for-update in the RDBMS deployment descriptor when set to true, will cause SELECT ...

messagedetail014012=EJB {0} uses optimistic-concurrency and disables cluster invalidation, but does not have verify-rows set to Read. This combination will prevent detection of stale data if the bean is never modified in a transaction.
cause014012=Optimistic concurrency beans verify consistency of data only if the bean has been modified, unless verify-rows is set to Read. If some other member of a cluster modifies a bean, other members will not be notified of this modification and will continue to store stale data unless the other members also attempt to modify the bean.

messagedetail014017=EJB {0} uses exclusive-concurrency and has the use-select-for-update element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor set to true. As the bean is locked at the server level during a transaction, select-for-update on the database is unnecessary.
cause014017=Exclusive concurrency is implemented by locking the bean at the server level when the bean participates in a transaction. Setting the element use-select-for-update in the RDBMS deployment descriptor to true causes SELECT ... FOR UPDATE to be used whenever the bean is loaded from the database, thus locking the row in the database too. This may be unnecessary, as the bean is locked by the container.

action015050=Check the bean code to determine what caused the transaction to not commit or roll back and fix the code.
