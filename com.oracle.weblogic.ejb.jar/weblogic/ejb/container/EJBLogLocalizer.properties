010198=An exception occurred while uninitializing the EJB module {0}.
010199=EJB {0} with run as role {1} has no run-as-principal-name specified in its deployment descriptor or annotation. The EJB container has chosen principal-name {2} from the security-role-assignment list for role {1} to be the run as principal name.
010201=The Message-Driven Bean {0} encountered an error while recovering a JMS session. This is a secondary error. The original error occurred while the Message-Driven Bean was processing a message. The recover action was taken in an attempt to recover from the original error, which will be logged separately.
010202=Call-by-reference is not enabled for EJB {0}. The server will have better performance if it is enabled. To enable call-by-reference, set the enable-call-by-reference element to True in the weblogic-ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor or corresponding annotation for this EJB.
010204=The EJB component, {0}, will be rolled back and redeployed to update class {1}. This class is not a bean implementation class. Only bean implementation classes can be updated without redeploying the entire module, and only when enable-bean-class-redeploy is set to True in weblogic-ejb.jar.xml.
010205=The EJB module, {0}, will be rolled back and redeployed to update the class {1}. Bean implementation classes, such as this, can be updated without redeploying the entire EJB module. However, this can only be done if enable-bean-class-redeploy is set to True in weblogic-ejb.jar.xml or the corresponding annotation. If this is the behavior you want, set this value to True and redeploy.
010206=The EJB module, {0}, will be rolled back and redeployed to update the class {1}. This bean implementation class could not be updated without redeploying the entire EJB module because it was changed incompatibly.

011051=Finder Collection in {0} is NULL.
011052=The deployment descriptor for an EJB 2.0 CMP bean conforms to the wrong document type. A common error is to specify an EJB 1.1 deployment descriptor by mistake. The RDBMS CMP deployment descriptor for an EJB 2.0 CMP bean must reference one of the following valid XML public ids:
011053=Error {0} received null when trying to get CMPBeanDescriptor for {1}.
011054=Duplicate {0} {1} found. The {0} is defined twice in two of the following descriptor files:
011055=Error deploying the EJB {0}, the JNDI name {1} is already in use. You must set a different JNDI name in the weblogic-ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor or corresponding annotation for this EJB before it can be deployed.
011057=The table {0} was created by the user. The container does not drop or alter user-created tables. The container would verify the table in this case.
011059=The container was unable to create the DDL file.
011060=The container was unable to determine the java.sql.Types of database columns.
011061=Stack trace associated with message {0} follows: \n
011062=The following exception has occurred: \n

011083=The EJB specification prohibits stateful session beans from using the TimerService.
011084=This EJB class does not support EJB timers and therefore is prohibited from using the TimerService. To use EJB timers, the bean class must implement javax.ejb.TimedObject or have a method that is annotated with @Timeout.
011085=This timer has either expired or been canceled and therefore cannot be invoked.
011086=The timer associated with this TimerHandle has either expired or been canceled.
011087=This TimerHandle is being invoked outside of the context of the application in which it was created. Since timers are local objects, they can only be called from within the same application in which they were created.
011088=The following error occurred while invoking the ejbTimeout(javax.ejb.Timer) method of EJB {0}.
011089=The following error occurred while attempting to remove an EJB timer from the persistent store for EJB {0}.
011090=The following error occurred while preparing to invoke the ejbTimeout(javax.ejb.Timer) method of EJB {0}.
011091=The table {0} cannot be dropped or created since it uses a trigger to update the optimistic column of the EJB. The container will only verify the existence of the table.
011092=In production mode, the DropAndCreate, DropAndCreateAlways, and AlterOrCreate options are ignored. The container will only attempt to verify the existence and increment value of the sequence {0}.
011093=The SEQUENCE named {0} with INCREMENT {1} was not found in the database. This SEQUENCE was specified in the CMP deployment descriptor to be used for automatic primary key generation.
011094=The SEQUENCE named {0} does not have INCREMENT value of {1} in the database as specified in the CMP deployment descriptor. Either modify the key-cache-value for this SEQUENCE in the deployment descriptor or update the SEQUENCE in the database.
011095=During EJB deployment, error(s) were encountered while attempting to CREATE the SEQUENCE named {0} with INCREMENT value {1}. \n {2}
011096=During EJB deployment, error(s) were encountered while setting up The SEQUENCE named {0} with INCREMENT value {1}. \n {2}
011097=During EJB deployment, error(s) were encountered while attempting to ALTER the SEQUENCE named {0} with INCREMENT value {1}. \n {2}
011098=No generated primary key was returned from the database insert statement as expected. Verify that the primary key database column for this EJB is an IDENTITY column as declared in the CMP deployment descriptor for this EJB.
011099=Multiple generated keys were returned from the database insert statement. The EJB container is unable to determine which generated key corresponds to the primary key column. To use the IDENTITY primary key generator, you must only have a single automatically generated database column per EJB.
011100=Automatic Key Generation: Error encountered while attempting to setup and verify SEQUENCE TABLE {0}.
011101=Automatic Key Generation Error: Sequence Table {0} has no rows. Table must have a single row with a SEQUENCE column.

011105=Automatic Key Generation Error: Could not resume callers TX after UPDATE of Sequence Table {0}. Exception message {1}.
011106=Invoking the set method of a cmp-field, configured to have a dbms-default-value in the WebLogic CMP deployment descriptor, is not allowed before the bean instance has been inserted into the database. The actual time in which the database insert occurs is dependent on several factors including whether batching or order-database-operations are enabled as well as the value of the delay-database-insert-until element of the WebLogic CMP deployment descriptor. Please refer to the documentation for details.
011107=Illegal attempt to invoke an EJB Timer instance from the ejbCreate() method of an EJB. The EJB specification specifically disallows invocations of Timers from ejbCreate methods.
011108=Illegal attempt to invoke an EJB Timer instance from the afterCompletion() method of a stateful session bean. The EJB specification specifically disallows invocations of Timers from the afterCompletion method.
011109=Failed to register JACC policy context handlers for the EJB container.
011110=The SEQUENCE named {0} has key-cache-size set to {1}, which is less than the INCREMENT_BY value for the sequence in the database. This may generate missing keys.
011111=The SEQUENCE named {0} has key-cache-size set to {1} which is greater than the INCREMENT_BY value for the sequence in the database. This is not allowed as it may generate duplicate keys.
011112=Error initializing the EJB Timer persistent store for the EJB {0}. The weblogic-ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor or annotation for this EJB contains a persistent-store-logical-name setting, but no persistent store with the logical name {1} could be found on the server {2}. Ensure a persistent store with the given logical store name exists on the specified server. Alternatively, you can remove the logical store name from your weblogic-ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor, causing each server''s default store to be used.
011113=Error: The Message Driven Bean "{0}", does not have a message destination configured. The message destination must be set using a message-destination-link, destination-resource-link, destination-jndi-name or a resource-adapter-jndi-name. Ensure the Message Driven Bean (MDB) is mapped to a message destination. This can be done in the ejb-jar.xml descriptor by specifying a message-destination-link for the MDB. A message destination can be set in the weblogic-ejb-jar.xml inside the message-driven-descriptor element. Use the destination-resource-link to map the MDB to an application-scoped JMS destination. The destination-jndi-name element can be used to map the MDB to the JNDI name of a JMS destination. Finally, the resource-adapter-jndi-name element can be used to map the MDB to the JNDI name of a JCA resource adapter. Annotation can also be used instead of using above deployment descriptor.
011114=Error: For EJB modules, deployment plan overrides are not supported with DTD based deployment descriptors. The EJB module {0} is attempting to apply a deployment plan to DTD based descriptors. Please update your EJB deployment descriptors to be schema based before attempting to apply the deployment plan override to this module. The weblogic.DDConverter utility can be used to automatically update your descriptors. Run the weblogic.DDConverter utility on your application to update the deployment descriptors. After the descriptors are updated, the deployment plan overrides can be applied to the EJB module properly.
011115=In EJB {0}, application called setXXX() method of a bean that uses ReadOnly concurrency. This operation is not allowed. Use Database or Optimistic concurrency instead.

013055=ejbSelects that return java.sql.ResultSet, cannot have Beans as SELECT targets. Only cmp-fields or aggregates (AVG, MAX, etc) are allowed. Found a SELECT argument {0} of type {1}, which does not meet this criteria. Please re-examine your query.
013057=\nProblem, in EJB QL the argument of OBJECT({0}) in SELECT OBJECT({0}) must be either a range variable identifier or a collection member identifier, either of which are defined in the query FROM clause as in "SELECT OBJECT(e) FROM EmployeeBean AS e" or "SELECT OBJECT(f) FROM EmployeeBean AS e, IN(e.friends)f". {0} is neither a range variable nor a collection member identifier. \n\nAction, review the EJB QL query and correct the SELECT clause.
013059=\nProblem, in EJB QL, the argument of OBJECT({0}) {0} must be an identifier that is declared as either a range variable identifier or a collection member identifier in the FROM clause of the query. {0} is a path expression terminating in a cmp-field. It is not an identifier declared in the FROM clause. \n\nAction, rewrite the query paying attention to the SELECT clause.
013061=\nNote, in EJB QL, the argument of SELECT single_valued_path_expression cannot be an identification_variable.
013062=Sub-queries can only SELECT beans that have simple, non-compound Primary Keys. The bean specified by {0} apparently has a compound key.
013064=Cannot reliably generate a query that contains a NOT MEMBER OF clause, when the target of the query SELECT clause is not a subset of or equal to the left-hand side of NOT MEMBER OF: {0} and when the left-hand side of NOT MEMBER OF: {0} is not a subset of or equal to the SELECT clause target. One must be the subset of or equal to the other.
013065=cannot perform Outer Join. Outer Join generation requires specification of a target database by including a database-type tag with the target database name in the weblogic-cmp-rdbms-jar.xml Deployment Descriptor file.
013066=Cannot do Outer Join between Bean: {0} and Bean: {1} for Database {2}. No database support for SQL Outer Join.
013067=Cannot do Outer Join between Bean: {0} and Bean: {1} for Database {2}. No database support for SQL Outer Join that involves more than two tables.
013068=Cannot compile this EJB QL query, because it will require at least {0} SQL OUTER JOINs. However, the specified database: {1} does not support this many OUTER JOINs per SQL Statement.
013069=Error. Cannot perform this query on Oracle because a generated WHERE clause in the Query or one of its SubQueries would contain both an OR clause and an OUTER JOIN. Oracle DBMS will not execute a Query/SubQuery that contains an OR clause and an OUTER JOIN. The generated WHERE clause in question would have been: "WHERE {0}"
013070=Error during deployment of EJB, {0}. The EJB references an application level cache, {1}. Applications that use this feature must be deployed using two-phase deployment. Make sure that "TwoPhase=true" is specified for the application in config.xml if you are deploying the application statically.
013071=The finder method: {0}, defined in the home interface of EJB {1}, does not have a corresponding finder element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor {2}. Make sure the corresponding finder element exists and any declared finder-param elements contain the fully-qualified Java type name of the parameter.
013072=For relation: {0} in weblogic-cmp-rdbms-jar.xml, join table {1} is defined. Join table for relationship other than many-to-many is not supported.
013073=finder/ejbSelect {0} has returned more than one value. We were expecting only ONE value. See EJB Spec 10.5.6.1, 10.5.7.1.
013074=Duplicate AS definition of {0} in FROM clause.
013075=\nProblem, the range variable identifier {0} has been declared more than once in the query. A range variable identifier value can only be declared once in a query, including any subqueries. \n\nAction, choose an alternative value for the duplicate range variable identifier currently declared as {0}.
013076=Error, could not find Range Variable, as declared in FROM clause, for EJBean: {0} with AbstractSchemaName: {1}.
013077=\nProblem, the collection member identifier {0} has been declared more than once in the query. A collection member identifier value can only be declared once in a query, including any subqueries. \n\nAction, choose an alternative value for the duplicate collection member identifier currently declared as {0}.
013078=Correlation variable {0} is defined more than once.
013079=The pathExpression/Identifier {0} contains a root: {1} that is not defined in an AS declaration in the FROM clause.
013080=The path expression/Identifier {0} starts with an identifier: {1}. The identifier {1}, which can be either a range variable identifier or a collection member identifier, is required to be declared in the FROM clause of its query or in the FROM clause of a parent query. {1} is not defined in the FROM clause of either its query or in any parent query.
013081=This EJB-QL query will produce an empty result if any of these underlying DBMS tables are empty: {0}. For more details regarding this behavior, see the EJB-QL section of the WebLogic Server documentation.
013082=The argument to IS [NOT] NULL must be a single valued path expression or a variable.\n. For example, a proper argument might be: \n "WHERE ?1 IS NULL" or \n "WHERE employee.manager IS NULL" where an employee can only have one manager.\n\n. Query found an IS [NOT] NULL argument {0} that is neither a single valued path expression or a variable.
013084=Exception during compilation: Finder method {0} of EJB {1} contains a GROUP BY clause and use-select-for-update is set to true for this EJB. The two are not compatible.
013085=All ejbSelect methods that select multiple fields must have a return type of java.sql.ResultSet. This method has a return type of {0}.
013086=The LIKE operator is missing an argument.\n The syntax for LIKE is single_valued_path_expression [NOT] LIKE pattern_value [ESCAPE escape-character] \n The single_valued_path_expression AND pattern_value are required.\n
013087=The first character {0} in the identifier {1} is not a valid first character to use in an EJB QL identifier. \n According to the EJB QL specification, the first character must return true when used as an argument to \n java.lang.Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(char c).
013088=The character {0} in the identifier {1} is not a valid character to use in an EJB QL identifier. \n According to the EJB QL specification, any character after the first character in the identifier must return true \n when used as an argument to java.lang.Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(char c).
013089=The character {0} in the identifier {1} is not a valid character to use in an EJB QL identifier. \n We are allowing the use of this character for backwards compatibility with earlier releases of WebLogic Server.
013090=Error processing query for EJB {0}: The UPPER and LOWER operators can only be used in the SELECT clause on path expressions ending in a CMP field of type String or Character. The variable {1} is not a path expression.
013091=Error processing query for EJB {0}: For all aggregate functions except COUNT, the path expression that is the argument to the aggregate function must terminate in a cmp-field. The expression {1} does not terminate in a cmp-field.
013092=NOTE: The original EJB QL Query has been rewritten for the following reasons: {0}\n\n Any compilation errors refer to the compilation of the rewritten EJB QL query.\n\n The original EJB QL Query was:
013093="NOT" Expressions have been factored out and removed to preserve any generated SQL joins.
013094=The SELECT clause of this query contains an identifier {0} that ends in a cmr-field. The EJB 2.1 specification section 11.2.7.1 requires that any related null objects belonging to the set corresponding to this cmr-field must be returned by this query however the database that will be used to execute this query does not sufficiently support SQL outer joins, therefore this query will not return any null objects that might otherwise be returned.
013095=Invalid relationship-caching name. No relationship-caching with the name {0} was declared for this EJB in the RDBMS deployment descriptor.
013096=\nProblem, in EJB QL in the clause "SELECT {0}". The expression {0} was expected to either contain an identification variable qualified by the OBJECT operator or a single_valued_path_expression. The single_valued_path_expression must consist of at least 2 elements separated by periods. \n\nAction, rewrite the SELECT clause of the query. See EJB2.x Specification for more details.
014000=Problem, encountered illegal value for transaction-isolation {0}.
014001=RDBMS descriptor {0} contains transaction-isolation settings. These settings may conflict with isolation-level settings in your weblogic-ejb-jar.xml descriptor and will be lost if you edit this descriptor in the console.
014003=EJB {0} uses optimistic concurrency and contains a finder or select method, {1}, for which include-updates is true. This combination of features does not work properly with database {2}.
014004=In EJB {0}, <generator-type> is set to {1}. It is incompatible with Batch Operations due to database limitations. Both order-database-operations and enable-batch-operations are turned off by EJB container.
014005=The configured dispatch policy {1} for Message-Driven Bean (MDB) {0} will be ignored: the MDB is not running in a WebLogic thread.
014006=The Message-Driven Bean (MDB) named {0} has a dispatch policy {1} that refers to an unknown execute queue thread pool. The default execute thread pool will be used instead.
014007=The bean named {0} contains BLOB or CLOB fields or both, and uses Optimistic Concurrency \n but no version or timestamp column has been specified. \n This may result in corruption of BLOB and CLOB data.
014008=In EJB {0}, {1} references an SqlShape element {2} that is not defined. The list of SqlShape elements that are defined for this EJB is: {3}.
014009=The Message-Driven Bean {0} of application {1} will now be suspended, as it listens to global JMS destination {2} and a new application version {3} is being redeployed.
014010=The Message-Driven Bean {0} of application {1} will now be suspended, as it listens to global JMS topic {2} and a new application version {3} is being redeployed. Note also that the current Message-Driven Bean is not a durable subscriber to the topic, and messages published by the topic after the currently active version of the Message-Driven Bean is suspended may not be received by the new application version.
014011=EJB {0} uses optimistic-concurrency and has the use-select-for-update element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor set to true. This combination of features is incompatible. The use-select-for-update is turned off by the EJB container in this case.
014012=EJB {0} uses optimistic-concurrency and disables cluster invalidation, but does not have verify-rows set to Read. This combination will prevent detection of stale data if the bean is never modified in a transaction.
014013=EJB {0} does not have a concurrency-strategy of either optimistic or readOnly and disables cluster invalidation. Cluster invalidation is relevant only for these concurrency strategies.
014014=The Message-Driven Bean (MDB) named {0} has a dispatch policy {1} that refers to an unknown work manager. The default work manager will be used instead.
014016=EJB {0} uses readonly-concurrency and has the use-select-for-update element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor set to true. As the bean is read-only, select-for-update is unnecessary.
014017=EJB {0} uses exclusive-concurrency and has the use-select-for-update element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor set to true. As the bean is locked at the server level during a transaction, select-for-update on the database is unnecessary.
014018=EJB {0} uses a verify-columns element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor. This element is applicable only for optimistic concurrency beans. Since this bean does not use optimistic concurrency, this element will be ignored.
014019=EJB {0} uses a verify-rows element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor. This element is applicable only for optimistic concurrency beans. Since this bean does not use optimistic concurrency, this element will be ignored.
014020=EJB {0} uses an optimistic-column element in the RDBMS deployment descriptor. This element is applicable only for optimistic concurrency beans. Since this bean does not use optimistic concurrency, this element will be ignored.
014021=The EJB {0} has been successfully deployed. The following remote interfaces have been bound into JNDI with the specified JNDI names:

015029=The EJB {0} contains an illegal value for the activation config property TopicMessagesDistributionMode. The specified value is {1} but the legal values are Compatibility, One-Copy-Per-Server, or One-Copy-Per-Application.
015030=The EJB {0} has an illegal permutation on distributed topic type and topicMessagesDistributionMode. Replicated distributed topics work with Compatibility, One-Copy-Per-Server, or One-Copy-Per-Application, but partitioned distributed topics only work with One-Copy-Per-Server or One-Copy-Per-Application. The EJB is configured to partitioned distributed topic and Compatibility.
015031=The EJB {0} has a distributedDestinationConnection configured but the EJB is configured to connect to a remote cluster. Since the distributedDestinationConnection configuration is only valid in a local cluster, the setting will be ignored.
015032=The EJB {0} is configured with the activation config property topicMessagesDistributionMode but the EJB is configured to connect to a JMS Queue. The topicMessagesDistributionMode is valid only for JMS Topic destinations.
015033=The EJB {0} has an invalid value configured for the activation config property {1}. Only WebLogic JMS server 10.3.4 or later versions support the values One-Copy-Per-Server or One-Copy-Per-Application. Prior to 10.3.4.0 Weblogic JMS server or other non-Weblogic JMS vendors, only the Compatibility value is supported.
