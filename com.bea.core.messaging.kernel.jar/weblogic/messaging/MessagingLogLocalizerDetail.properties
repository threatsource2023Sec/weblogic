messagedetail282000=The version {0} is not between the expected versions {1} and {2}. This is an unexpected failure.
cause282000=While attempting to interoperate between different releases or service packs, an error occurred while attempting to serialize or deserialize an object. The version number of the object was not in the expected range. If {0} is larger than {2}, then it is possible an attempt was made to access a newer version than the current version. Otherwise, a possible attempt has been made to interoperate with an unsupported older version.
action282000=Ensure that the versions of Oracle products that are interoperating are supported. If the versions need to be supported, contact My Oracle Support.

messagedetail282001=This message is logged when the messaging kernel begins recovering persistent messages. The messaging kernel is used by JMS and by the store-and-forward feature.
cause282001=This is normal operation.
action282001=No action is required.
severity282002=64
messagedetail282002=This message is logged when the messaging kernel finished recovering persistent messages. The messaging kernel is used by JMS and by the store-and-forward agent.

severity282003=64
messagedetail282003=This message is logged when the messaging kernel determines how many bytes it will use for paging. This parameter is controlled by the MessageBufferSize parameter on the JMSServerMBean or on the SAFAgentMBean. The messaging kernel is used by JMS and by the store-and-forward agent.
cause282003=This is normal operation.
action282003=No action is required.
messagedetail282004=In the event of a failure of the persistent store, redirection of messages by the messaging kernel may stop. In order to maintain data integrity, it is necessary to restart WebLogic Server so that it can determine what happened before the failure. This affects messages that expired or reached their maximum redelivery limit. The messaging kernel is used by JMS and by the store-and-forward agent.
cause282004=See the previous error messages, which should explain the cause.
action282004=Restart the WebLogic Server.
severity282005=16
messagedetail282005=There was an error while redirecting a message that has expired or reached its redelivery limit. The messaging kernel may recover from this error, or it may log another error message if it cannot.
cause282005=See the attached detail message.
action282005=No action is required.
severity282006=16
messagedetail282006=There was an error while deleting a message that has expired. The messaging kernel may recover from this error, or it may log another error message if it cannot.

severity282011=16
messagedetail282011=There was an error making a message visible after a delivery delay.
cause282011=Most likely, a transient I/O error occurred.
action282011=Consider restarting the server if the error persists. The message will not be lost.
severity282012=16
messagedetail282012=There was a failure while performing paging I/O.
cause282012=Either a transient I/O error occurred, or the server did not have enough memory to complete the paging I/O request.
action282012=Consider restarting the server if the error persists.

stack282013=false
messagedetail282013=Skipping unexpected null message encountered on store boot.
cause282013=Message data corruption has occurred. The corrupted message will be skipped to allow data recovery on other non-corrupted messages.
action282013=Report this issue to My Oracle Support.
severity282014=16
stack282014=false
messagedetail282014=System property "weblogic.store.StoreBootOnError" is enabled, skipping 2PC record on boot because associated message element is missing.
cause282014=Potential message data corruption has occurred. A 2PC record was found in the store without an associated message reference element. The 2PC record will be ignored.
action282014=Contact My Oracle Support.
messagedetail282015=An unexpected null message body was detected when writing a message to the persistent store.

messagedetail282016=The SAF Agent detected a conflict during upgrade; there are pre-12.2.1.0.0 SAF messages and 12.2.1.x.0 SAF messages in the SAF agent's persistent stores. The data in the old store connections are ignored while the data in the new store connections are recovered.
cause282016=The SAF agent in question has been upgraded from a pre-12.2.1.0.0 release to an unpatched 12.2.1.x.0 release while it had unprocessed persistent messages, and then upgraded to a patched 12.2.1.x.0 release. As a result, there are pre-12.2.1.0.0 data (which were ignored during the first upgrade), and unpatched 12.2.1.x.0 data in the store.
action282016=Use -Dweblogic.saf.StoreUpgradeMode="OldOnly" to recover only the old messages. Use -Dweblogic.saf.StoreUpgradeMode="IgnoreOld" to suppress this warning message. Or contact My Oracle Support.
