messagedetail119000=A Logging Last Resource (LLR) is the only resource participating in a global one-phase transaction but the LLR local transaction failed. All operations will, or already have, either all rolled back, or all committed, but it is unknown which. The transaction is still atomic.
cause119000=If the LLR is a database, there are a number of possible root causes. Among them are: the database may have shut down or crashed during the call to local commit, the database connection may have failed, the database local transaction may have timed out, or the database may have detected a potential deadlock condition introduced by application operations within the local commit.
action119000=Examine the root exception generated by the LLR to determine the root cause of the problem.
severity119001=16
messagedetail119001=A Logging Last Resource (LLR) is participating in a global transaction but the LLR local transaction failed. All operations associated with the LLR either all rolled back or all committed, but it is unknown which. Operations associated with additional resources in the transaction are in a prepared state and will not be committed or rolled back until the transaction manager can successfully query the LLR to determine if the LLR committed or rolled back its operations. The transaction manager will periodically test if the LLR local transaction committed by checking for the presence of the global commit record within the LLR transaction table. If the test determines that the global commit record was persisted in the LLR transaction table, then the LLR local transaction committed, and the transaction manager will commit the remaining resources (branches) in the global transaction. If the test determines that the global commit record was not persisted, then the LLR local transaction rolled back, and the transaction manager will roll back the remaining resources in the global transaction.
cause119001=If the LLR is a database, there are a number of possible root causes. Among them are: the database may have shut down or crashed during the call to local commit, the database connection may have failed, the database local transaction may have timed out, or the database may have detected a potential deadlock condition introduced by application operations within the local commit.
action119001=Examine the root exception generated by the LLR resource to determine the root cause of the problem.

messagedetail119002=While the server is running, the server's transaction manager may use any configured Logging Last Resource (LLR) to persist the transaction state. If a configured LLR cannot be loaded during boot, then the server cannot boot, as the LLR may contain transaction records for committed two-phase transactions that have not completed committing all resources involved in the transaction.
cause119002=If the LLR is a JDBC LLR connection, there are a number of possible root causes. Among them are: the database may have shut down or crashed, the database connection may have failed during boot, or the database connection may have incorrect database permissions.
action119002=Examine the root exception generated by the LLR resource to determine the root cause of the problem.
severity119003=4
messagedetail119003=While a server is running, the server's transaction manager may use any configured Logging Last Resource (LLR) to persist the transaction state. A configured LLR returned a corrupted record during a subsequent boot.
cause119003=The cause is unknown, but could be possible disk corruption.
action119003=Examine the root exception generated by the LLR to determine the root cause of the problem. Possible solutions are: restore LLR resource tables from backup, delete the failing LLR table (which risks producing heuristic hazards), or contact My Oracle Support.
messagedetail119004=Invalid configuration value of user-preferred server for server [{0}].
cause119004=The value of the user-preferred server is invalid. It must be [{0}].
action119004=Change the value of the user-preferred server of JTAMigratableTargetMBean [{0}] from [{1}] to [{0}].
messagedetail119005=JTA subsystem failed. A forced shutdown of the server was done because the server is in automatic JTA migration mode.
cause119005=The JTA subsystem failed.
action119005=JTA Transaction Recovery Service will be automatically migrated to back up the server.
severity119006=4
messagedetail119006=While the server is running, the server's transaction manager may use the configured Transaction Log Primary Store to persist the transaction state. If a configured Transaction Log Primary Store cannot be loaded during boot, then the server cannot boot, as the Transaction Log Primary Store may contain transaction records for committed two-phase transactions that have not completely committed all resources involved in the transaction.
cause119006=See the message detail.
action119006=Examine the root exception generated by the Transaction Log Primary Store to determine the root cause of the problem.
