severity171512=4
stack171512=false
messagedetail171512=The embedded LDAP server initializes a new replica in a Managed Server by downloading a new replica from the Administration Server and then importing it into the local replicated LDAP server. If this process fails, the embedded LDAP server attempts to clean up and delete the local files. However, file {0} could not be deleted. The {1} directory and all its files must be deleted manually.
cause171512=It is not always possible to delete files that are open by a process.

messagedetail171520=An embedded LDAP server is already using this directory. Since in-memory data structures are used, two embedded LDAP servers cannot run at the same time in the same directory. WebLogic Server will wait for {1} seconds and then retry to obtain the exclusive lock in case the other WebLogic Server instance is still shutting down.
cause171520=An exclusive lock for the directory {0} could not be obtained because another WebLogic Server is already using this directory.
action171520=If the server eventually boots, ignore this warning as the lock was obtained. If the server fails to boot, ensure that the first WebLogic Server is shut down and try restarting the server.
