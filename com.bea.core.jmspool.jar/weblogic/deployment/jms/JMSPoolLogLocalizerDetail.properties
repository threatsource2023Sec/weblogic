messagedetail169800=A PooledConnectionFactory could not be read from JNDI because the version of WebLogic Server that stored it is not compatible with the version that is retrieving it.
cause169800=The version of WebLogic Server that stored the PooledConnectionFactory object is not compatible with the version that is retrieving it.
action169800=Contact My Oracle Support.
messagedetail169801=The application code attempted to call a method on the JMS API that is not allowed by the Java EE specifications. Certain methods are restricted for use by the Application Server so that it can maintain a pool of JMS objects.
cause169801=The application code has violated the Java EE specifications.
action169801=Change the code to avoid calling the specified method.
messagedetail169802=An EJB or servlet was deployed using a JMS connection factory resource that has a res-auth setting of Container, but the application code attempted to open a JMS connection using a username and password. In this case, the username and password are supplied by WebLogic Server.
cause169802=The application code is not using the Java EE APIs properly.
action169802=Either remove the username and password, or set the res-auth element to Application.
messagedetail169803=The server attempted to look up a JMS connection factory at the specified location, but the lookup failed.
cause169803=The remote JNDI server or JMS server is not available, or the name was incorrectly specified.
action169803=Check that the server is running, and check the name in the deployment descriptor XML files.
messagedetail169804=A JMS connection factory that was retrieved from JNDI is either a QueueConnectionFactory when a TopicConnectionFactory was expected or vice versa or the object is of neither type.
cause169804=Either the name of the connection factory in the deployment descriptor XML files is wrong, or the wrong object was bound into JNDI.
action169804=Check the name in the XML files against what is actually registered in JNDI.
severity169805=64
messagedetail169805=There was a problem with a JMS connection that was being used in a servlet or EJB. The connection has been closed, and will be reopened the next time it is used, if possible.
cause169805=The JMS server is unavailable or there is some other problem with it that makes it impossible to send or receive messages.
action169805=Check the configuration parameters for the JMS server, and check that it is available on the network.
messagedetail169806=A JMS destination is either a queue when a topic was expected or vice versa or the object is of neither type.
cause169806=Change the application to use a valid destination type.
action169806=Change the application to use a valid destination type.
severity169807=16
messagedetail169807=When an EJB, JSP, or servlet that uses a JMS connection factory as a resource-reference is first deployed, the server tries to connect to the JMS provider. The server will attempt the connection again later when the JMS resource is actually used.

action169808=No action is required.
messagedetail169809=An error occurred while attempting to register a JMS session resource with the transaction system.
cause169809=The JMS connection factory specified does not properly support XA or something is wrong with the transaction system.
action169809=Check the linked exception and verify that the JMS provider properly supports XA.
messagedetail169810=The transaction system was unable to commit or roll back a transaction that the Java EE container started in order to handle a JMS operation.
cause169810=There was a problem with the transaction system.
action169810=See the linked exception for more information.
messagedetail169811=The "close" method has been closed on a JMS object, so it is no longer possible to invoke methods on the object.
cause169811=The object has been closed.
action169811=Fix the programming error.
messagedetail169812=A pooled JMS session is enlisted in a transaction, and it either may not be used in another transaction or it may not be used outside a transaction.
cause169812=Check the application code to ensure that a pooled JMS session (retrieved from the JNDI java:comp/env/jms context) is not kept between transactions. It should be closed so that it is returned to the pool.
action169812=Check the application code.
severity169813=16
messagedetail169813=The session pool or pooled connection object encountered an error while closing, but it was closed anyway.
cause169813=See the linked exception for more information.
action169813=No action is required.
messagedetail169814=The resource pool subsystem has disabled the JMS session pool, so it may not be used.
cause169814=An administrative action was taken.
action169814=Re-enable the session pool.
messagedetail169815=A JMS session pool was either created directly by the user or by internal container code that did not properly specify a property.
cause169815=A JMS session pool was either created directly by the user or by internal container code that did not properly specify a property.
action169815=Check for other log messages that give more information about the failure.
messagedetail169816=An operation was attempted against a JMS session pool, but the pool is in the middle of shutting down.
cause169816=The pool is being shut down, possibly because of an error.
action169816=Check for other errors that indicate why the pool is being shut down and retry the operation.

messagedetail169817=The JMS connection factory was defined as a resource-reference for the specified EJB. Since the connection factory does not support XA, it may not be used inside a transaction context or an exception will occur.
cause169817=If the specified JMS connection factory is intended to be used inside a transaction context, then the EJB was configured improperly.
action169817=If the specified JMS connection factory is intended for use inside a transaction context, then the connection factory used by the EJB must be changed so that it supports XA, or the EJB descriptor must be changed to point to a different connection factory. However, if the connection factory will never be used inside a transaction context, then no action is necessary.

messagedetail169818=The JMS connection pool named "{0}" has a configured connection factory JNDI name of "{1}". However, an object that is not a javax.jms.ConnectionFactory is bound to that JNDI name. The object bound to that JNDI name has type "{2}".
cause169818=An object other than a ConnectionFactory is bound to the configured JNDI name of the connection pool.
action169818=Either change the JNDI name of the JMS connection pool property or change the JNDI name of the object that is currently bound into JNDI.
messagedetail169819=The resource pool subsystem detected an error which makes the JMS session pool unusable.
cause169819=There is a problem with the resource pool.
action169819=See the linked exception for details.
messagedetail169820=TemporaryQueue and TemporaryTopic objects, once created, may only be used to create message consumers that were created using the same connection that was used to create the temporary destination.
cause169820=This is an application programming error.
action169820=Change the application code.
messagedetail169821=The server was not able to create a wrapper for the specified class. The wrapper is used to intercept certain methods from the JMS provider to provide WebLogic Server-specific behavior.
cause169821=There may be an error with the classpath or with the underlying JMS provider's code.
action169821=Check the classpath. If this does not fix the problem, contact My Oracle Support.
messagedetail169822=An EJB or servlet attempted to use a wrapped JMS session that it acquired from a resource-ref inside a transaction context, but the JMS session cannot participate in the transaction because two-phase commit is not available from the connection factory.
cause169822=The JMS connection factory specified does not support two-phase commit.
action169822=For WebLogic Server JMS, two-phase commit may be enabled by setting the "UserTransactionsEnabled" flag on the JMS connection factory. For other JMS providers, you must specify a JMS connection factory that supports XA.
messagedetail169823=User call to createQueueConnection() returned an unexpected type class.
cause169823=Probable cause is the JMS 1.1 ConnectionFactory with the JMS 1.0.2 createQueueConnection() API. Some JMS providers do not support backward compatibility.
action169823=Either change the API call to createConnection() or change the connection factory type to QueueConnectionFactory.
messagedetail169824=User call to createTopicConnection() returned an unexpected type class.
cause169824=Probable cause is the JMS 1.1 ConnectionFactory with the JMS 1.0.2 createTopicConnection() API. Some JMS providers do not support backward compatibility.
action169824=Either change the API call to createConnection() or change the connection factory type to TopicConnectionFactory.
messagedetail169825=An EJB or servlet was deployed using a JMS connection factory resource that has a res-auth setting of Container, but the application code attempted to create a JMSContext using a username and password. In this case, the username and password are supplied by WebLogic Server.
cause169825=The application code is not using the Java EE APIs properly.
