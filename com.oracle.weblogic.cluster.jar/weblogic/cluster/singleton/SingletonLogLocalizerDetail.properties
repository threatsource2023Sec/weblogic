messagedetail003501=The migration of server {0} from machine {1} has failed. No suitable candidate machines could be found. The server was tried on all candidate machines, and either the machines were unreachable or the server failed to start.
cause003501=No candidate machines are available, or the server {0} has encountered an error on booting independent of its location.
action003501=Further migration of server {0} has been disabled. When the cause of the problem has been determined and fixed, the server {0} should be started by the user, at which point it will resume standard automatic migration behavior.

stack003502=false
messagedetail003502=The server {0} has failed, and cannot be restarted on machine {1}. See the logs of {0} to determine why. Since server migration is enabled for server {0}, it will now be started on {2}.
cause003502=The failure of server {0} has provoked a migration attempt to a new machine, machine {2}.
action003502=No action is required, but the logs of server {0} should be examined to determine why it crashed and could not successfully restart on machine {1}.
severity003503=64
stack003503=false
messagedetail003503=Server {0} is now active on machine {2}, having failed to be restarted on machine {1}.
cause003503=The failure of server {0} provoked a migration attempt to a new machine, machine {2}. The migration is now complete.
action003503=No action is required.
severity003504=64
stack003504=false
messagedetail003504=The migration of server {0} from machine {1} to machine {2} has failed, because machine {2} is not reachable. This is not an error. The search for a machine where server {0} can successfully start will continue.
cause003504=Machine {2} was not reachable. A new machine for server {0} will be chosen.
action003504=No action is required.
