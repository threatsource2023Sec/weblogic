severity130000=16
stack130000=false
messagedetail130000=XML entities to be cached cannot be larger than the size of the cache itself. The cache has rejected the entity.
cause130000=The cache may be too small or a specific item might be very large. The worst case is that this indicates a denial of service attack.
action130000=No action is required. However, performance will be best if items are cached.
severity130001=16
messagedetail130001=Attempts to insert or retrieve items from the XML entity cache are failing for unknown reasons. This does not prevent XML parsing, but parse performance will be impacted. Also, the cache provides a backup in the case of a network failure. If the cache is not operational, this backup is not in effect.
cause130001=Unknown
action130001=No action is required. However, performance will increase if items are cached. Also the cache provides a backup in the case of a network failure. While the cache is not operating, this backup is not in effect.
severity130002=16
messagedetail130002=A check is made just after an entity is added to the cache to ensure that the entity can be retrieved. The test failed for the current entity.
cause130002=Usually this indicates that the entity timeout was set to a very small value. Otherwise, there is some unknown problem with the cache module itself.
action130002=No action is required, but XML parse performance will be impacted. Also, there is no cached copy to act as a backup in the event of a network failure.
messagedetail130003=The factory class specified in the Administration Console or MBean could not be instantiated. The factory can be of type: SAXParserFactory, DocumentBuilderFactory, TransformerFactory, XPathFactory, SchemaFactory, XMLInputFactory, XMLOutputFactor, or XMLEventFactory. Proceeding with the default factory.
cause130003=The class name of the factory was not correct or it was not in the CLASSPATH.
action130003=Check the CLASSPATH or verify the Administration Console entry or MBean value.

stack130006=false
messagedetail130006=Entry exceeds cache memory size.
cause130006=The entry is larger than the cache.
