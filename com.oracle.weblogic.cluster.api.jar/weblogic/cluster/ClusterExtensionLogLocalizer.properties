003101=Modified non-dynamic {0} property on the Administration Server.
003102=There was a failure in the execution of the post script {0} while deactivating MigratableTarget {1}. Since post script failure is marked as fatal, the MigratableTarget will not be automatically migrated. To enable automigration, fix the post script failure and manually migrate the failed migratable target or disable the post script failure fatal flag.
003103={0} failed to release its lease because of {1}. This may affect its automatic migration behavior.
003104=Failed to notify the execution failure of the post script {1} for {0} to the SingletonServiceStateManager because of {2}. This may affect its automatic migration behavior.
003105=The asynchronous replication request timed out while attempting to add object {0} to the replication queue. This session has not been replicated to any backup at this point.
003106=An unexpected exception occured during replication: {0}. Future session updates should replicate as expected.
003107=Lost {0} unicast message(s).
003108=Unicast receive error : {0}
003109=Cluster {0} uses a database as the migration basis but no data source for migration has been configured.
003110=Connection attempt was rejected because the incoming protocol {1} is not enabled on channel {0}.
003111=No channel exists for replication calls for cluster {0}.
003112=Channels "{0}" configured for replication traffic.
003113=Using one-way RMI for replication
003114=Ignoring one-way RMI calls for replication because multiple replication channels are not present.
003115=Failed to synchronize a secondary session due to missing updates.
003116=Starting Member Death Detector.
003117=Starting Member Death Detector Heartbeat Receiver.
003118=WLS Server "{0}" does not have an associated machine configured. Member Death Detector will not be enabled for this server.
003119=The singleton service {0} is now registered on this server but will not be activated because this server is not part of a cluster.
003120=Hostname {0} failed to resolve during cluster initialization.
003121=Unicast cluster may not function correctly as the listen address of server {0} is not specified.
003122={0} : A cluster that has migratable servers could not create/execute an SQL statement when validating the database connection. The cluster is misconfigured. Check the leasing table on the database and connection configuration.
003123=Singleton Monitor has detected that the singleton service {0} is in a failed state.
003124=Singleton Monitor has detected that the singleton service {0} has an expired status.
003125=Singleton Monitor has detected that the singleton service {0} has no lease.
003126={0} will attempt to auto-migrate.
003127={0} will attempt to restart in place on server {1}.
003128={0} has been completed to restart in place.
003129={0} will attempt to auto-migrate from {1} to {2}.
003130={0} successfully activated on server {1}.
003131=The singleton service {0} has failed with failure state : {1}. Summary of reason Code : {2}
003132=An EJB is configured to use the clustered EJB timer implementation but the data-source-for-job-scheduler cluster attribute is not configured.
003133=An EJB is configured to use the clustered EJB timer implementation but the data-source-for-job-scheduler attribute is not configured in partition "{0}".
003134=An EJB is configured to use the clustered EJB Timer implementation but this server is not part of a cluster.
003135=Job Scheduler service was not started for this partition because the data source for the job scheduler is not configured for this partition.
003136=Job scheduler service was not started for this partition because this server does not belong to a cluster.
003137=Server in cluster {0} was unable to bind MulticastSocket to address {0}. Will bind to IP_ANY instead.
003138=Synchronized {1} from server {0}.
003139=AssertionError is raised on installing ServiceOffer from remote node : {0}
003140=Partition {0} from server {1} {2} for cluster view {3}
003141=Thread {0} attempted a re-entrant call to the WLS Replication Service while actively replicating session state to a secondary server.
003142=An exception occurred while ensuring replica {0} replicated: {1}
003143=An exception occurred while locally cleaning up replica {0} for replication key {1}: {2}
003144=All session objects should be serializable to replicate. Check the objects in the session. Failed to replicate a non-serializable object in context {0}.
003145=An exception occurred while starting TimerMaster for {0}: {1}
003146=Unicast cluster may not function correctly as the listen address of server {0} is not specified.
003147=Detected Exception occurred when calling {0} method. Timer info: {1}
003148=The Clustered Timer: {0} has failed to successfully time out in {1} consecutive attempts. Scheduler will automatically delay the timeout for {2} seconds. Timer info: {3}
003149=Failed to fire retry timer because of Leasing problem and reset retry state. Timer info: {0}
003150=Server \"{0}\" has acquired the role of Singleton Master for the cluster.
003151=Server \"{0}\" is no longer the Singleton Master for the cluster.
003152=Timeout while trying to execute a SQL operation. Attempted Query {0}, Params {1}, Exception {2}.
003153=Timeout while trying to execute a SQL operation. Attempted Query {0}, Params {1}, Exception {2}. The server will retry in a few seconds.
003154=The cluster service detected that the leasing table "{0}" already exists in the database.
003155=Cluster service did not find leasing table at "{0}", so it created one using the commands in file "{1}".
003156=Cluster service did not find an already existing leasing table and failed trying to create a new empty table using the commands in file "{0}" due to "{1}".
003157=Cluster service did not find an already existing leasing table and failed to create a new empty table because the JDBC driver is unknown and/or unsupported. To force table creation with an unknown and/or unsupported driver, see the cluster service "AutoMigrationTableCreationDDLFile" configuration attribute. Driver information: database type = "{0}", product name = "{1}", driver name = "{2}".
003158=Cluster service did not find an already existing leasing table and failed to create a new empty table because it could not locate the configured DDL file "{0}".
003159=Cluster service failed to detect the leasing table due to database access error : {0}.
