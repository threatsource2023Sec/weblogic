messagedetail150000=An error occurred while the Managed Server was attempting to establish a connection to the Administration Server MBeanHome at the specified URL: {0}.
cause150000=An improper Administration Server URL has been specified, or the Administration Server is not available at the specified URL. Commonly this is because the Managed Server shares an adminstration URL with the Administration Server. Another possibility is that the host identified by {0}, or the local host, is not configured properly. For instance, an /etc/hosts or DNS lookup on the hostname results in a loopback address.
action150000=Verify that the URL specified for the Administration Server is valid, unique and that the Administration Server is available and listening at the specified URL. A common problem is that the administration port is enabled and both the Administration Server and Managed Server are running on the same machine. In this instance a different administration port should be selected for the Managed Server. Another possibility is that the host identified by {0}, or the local host, is not configured properly. For instance, an /etc/hosts or DNS lookup on the hostname results in a loopback address.
messagedetail150001=An error occurred while the Managed Server was attempting to connect to the Administration Server to obtain configuration information.
cause150001=The Administration Server might currently be unavailable or the specified URL: {0} or username: {1} might be invalid.
action150001=Confirm that the designated Administration Server is running and that the specified URL: {0} and username: {1} are valid for this configuration.

messagedetail150018=This server is being started in Managed Server independence mode and will attempt to use a local copy of the configuration to start.
cause150018=The Managed Server was unable to communicate with the Adminstration Server at the provided URL because the specified Administration Server either was not running or was partitioned.
action150018=Restart the Administration Server with Managed Server discovery enabled so that the running Managed Server can synchronize its configuration with the Administration Server and become centrally managed.
messagedetail150020=The Managed Server cannot start due to a configuration problem that prevents it from accessing the Administration Server.
cause150020=The Managed Server was given a URL on which the Administration Server could not be contacted.
action150020=Inspect the Administration Server address:port provided to the Managed Server that is being started. This address should be changed to point to the Administration Server rather than resolving locally on the Managed Server.
messagedetail150021=The Managed Server cannot start due to incorrectly provided credentials that prevent it from being authenticated by the Administration Server.
cause150021=The username and password combination was not correct.
action150021=Inspect the username and password of the user starting the Managed Server and supply the correct credentials. The username and password are specified on startup with -Dweblogic.management.username and -Dweblogic.management.password command line options to the java weblogic.Server command.

stack150041=false
messagedetail150041=The Administration Server does not know about this server.
cause150041=The -Dweblogic.Name command line property specifies a server that does not exist in the configuration that is active on the Administration Server. This can occur if the Managed Server was added to the configuration along with non-dynamic changes that affect the Administration Server. In this case, the Administration Server must be restarted.
action150041=Check to see if the Administration Server is marked as needing a restart. If it is, then restart the Administration Server before trying to start this Managed Server. Check the configuration for the list of configured servers.
severity150042=4
messagedetail150042=When starting a Managed Server, the -Dweblogic.management.server property determines the host and port used to communicate with the Administration Server. If the Administration Server is configured to have a port that supports administrator privileges, then specify that administration port when starting the Managed Server. If a port that does not have administrator privileges is specified, then the Managed Server will not be able to communicate with the Administration Server and will start and remain in Managed Server independence mode.
cause150042=The specified Administration Server port does not support the administrator traffic required to allow the Managed Server to communicate with the Administration server.

However, a JMSSystemResourceMBean of name {1} could not be found. The JMS server {0} will not boot until this problem has been fixed.
cause150049=The temporary template for a JMS server must come from a JMSSystemResourceMBean. A common mistake is to put the temporary template into an AppDeployment. However, because the temporary template must be owned by the administrator, all temporary templates must come from JMSSystemResourceMBeans, not AppDeployments.
