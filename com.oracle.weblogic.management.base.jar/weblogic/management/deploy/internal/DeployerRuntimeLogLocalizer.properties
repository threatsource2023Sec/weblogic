149000=Unable to create DeployerRuntimeMBean.
149001=No application named "{0}" exists for operation "{1}".
149002=The source file was not provided for activation of application: "{0}".
149003=Unable to access application source information in "{0}" for application "{1}". The specific error is: {2}.
149004=Failures were detected while initiating {1} task for application "{0}".
149011=Some of the targets in the deployment request are not configured in this domain. The named targets are: "{0}".
149013=Application "{0}" does not define the module, "{1}". {2} are the known valid module(s) for this application.
149014=Target "{0}" is not defined.
149015=Unable to add "{0}" to component "{1}".
149021=Rejecting {2} request for application "{1}". The specified ID, {0}, is already being used.
149025=An invalid attempt was made to target a non-Web application component, "{1}", in application "{0}" to a virtual host, "{2}".
149026={2} application {0} on {1}.
149027=Unable to activate the application "{1}" from source "{0}". Reason: {2}
149028=An invalid path, "{1}", was specified for the application "{0}".
149031=The staging mode of "{0}" is invalid. The legal values are "stage" or "nostage".
149032=An attempt to restart a task has been rejected. The task has already been started.
149033={2} application {0} on {1}.
149034=An exception occurred for task {0}: {1}.
149035=Module {0} reported error: {1}.
149038=Initiating task for {1} : {0}.
149040=An attempt to change the staging mode for the application "{0}" has been rejected.
149045=An attempt to add cluster target "{0}" was rejected, since cluster member "{1}" is also targeted by module "{2}". Targeting to a cluster member results in different behaviors than targeting to the entire cluster.
149048=An attempt to add server target "{1}" to module "{2}" has been rejected. This is because its parent cluster, "{0}", is also targeted by the module.
149054=An attempt to add a virtual host target "{0}" to a non-Web application module "{1}" has been rejected.
149055=Adding server {1} of cluster {0} as a target for module {3}. This module also includes server {2} that belongs to this cluster as one of its additional targets. Having multiple individual servers of a cluster as targets instead of having the entire cluster as the target can result in non-optimal load balancing and scalability. Therefore, this is not usually recommended.
149058=Distribute can only have stage as its staging mode. Application "{0}" has {1} as its staging mode.
149059=Module {1} of application {0} is transitioning from {2} to {3} on server {4}.
149060=Module {1} of application {0} successfully transitioned from {2} to {3} on server {4}.
149061=Module {1} of application {0} failed to transition from {2} to {3} on server {4}.
149062=The task containing ID {0} cannot be canceled, since it has already completed execution.
149066=Unable to deploy application "{0}", because module "{1}" does not provide a valid URI.
149068=This is an unexpected exception.
149069=Deploying {0} using a deprecated protocol.
149073=The application "{0}" has no configured modules.
149074=Successfully completed deployment task: {0}.
149078=Stack trace for message {0}
149080=A partial update of an archived application is not allowed. Application "{0}" cannot be redeployed.
149081=Cannot {2} application, "{0}", with version "{1}". The application was previously deployed without a version.
149082=Cannot {2} application "{0}" without a version. The application was previously deployed with version "{1}".
149083=An attempt was made to activate the application "{0}" when stop was in progress.
149085=No application version was specified for application "{0}". The {2} operation will be performed against the currently active version "{1}".
149086=The application {0} is being retired gracefully.
149087=The application {0} will be retired after {1} seconds.
149088=The retirement for application {0}, which was scheduled to happen after {1} seconds, is canceled.
149089=An attempt was made to activate the application "{0}" when retirement was in progress.
149091=An attempt was made to deploy application "{0}" with specified archive version "{1}". However, the application archive, as specified in the source, has version "{2}".
149092=The source is not specified for the deployment operation of application "{0}", and the expected version is "{1}". However, the application archive at the source location for a previous deployment of version "{1}" now has version "{2}".
149093=No version specified for the versioned application named "{0}" for operation {1}, and no active version is available.
149095=The application {0} is being retired now.
149096=Operation {1} is deprecated and cannot be applied to versioned application "{0}". Use operation {2} instead.
149097=The retirement for application "{0}" failed.
149098=An attempt was made to gracefully undeploy the application "{0}" when retirement was in progress.
149099=Unexpected errors occurred while sending deployment event {1} on behalf of application "{0}".
149100=Unexpected errors occurred while sending a vetoable deployment event on behalf of application "{0}".
149101=Application "{0}" is not deployed on target "{1}". Therefore, it cannot be undeployed or removed. The requested operation {2} is valid only on the deployed targets of the application.
149102=Production redeployment is not supported for application "{0}", which is of module type {1}. Production redeployment is supported for the following module types only: {2}. If not attempting to perform production redeployment, try deploying without a version.
149103=An exception occurred while executing task {0} for application "{1}": {2}.
149104=Update request for "{0}" does not specify any descriptors to be updated
149105=An attempt was made to deploy a library located at "{2}" with name "{0}", which is different from the one specified in the manifest of the library: "{1}".

149107=An attempt was made to deploy library "{0}" with specified specification version "{1}" and implementation version "{2}". However, the library manifest has specification version "{3}" and implementation version "{4}".
149108=Failures were detected while initiating {0} task.
149110=An exception occurred while processing the completion of the task {0}, {1}. The active application version state may not have been updated.
149111=Application "{0}" is non-versioned, and an attempt was made to redeploy application "{0}" with the source. Redeploying with the source is only allowed when redeploying a new version of a versioned application. Try redeploying again without specifying the source.
149112=Application "{0}" is already deployed, and the attempt was made to redeploy application "{0}" again with source. Redeploying with the source is only allowed when redeploying a new version of the application. Try redeploying again without specifying the source or with a new version.
149113=Cannot deploy or redeploy application "{0}" because the maximum number of application versions ({2}) for application "{1}" has been exceeded. Currently deployed versions are: "{3}".
149114=Cannot deploy or redeploy application "{0}" with version identifier "{1}" because the maximum length of the version identifier ({2}) has been exceeded.
149115=Cannot deploy or redeploy application "{0}" with invalid version identifier "{1}". Version identifiers may only contain alphanumerics, period, underscore, and hyphen and must be less than 215 characters in length.
149116=Cannot obtain the deployment configuration.
149117={2} library {0} on {1}.
149118="{1}" is not targeted to "{0}".
149119=Different targets cannot be specified when deploying a new version "{1}" of application "{0}". The targets specified, "{3}", are different from those of the previous version, "{2}".
149120=The plan version "{1}" cannot be specified when deploying a non-versioned application "{0}".
149121=Rejecting {1} request for application {0} because the deployment service is not started.
149122=Deployment perations on internal application "{0}" are not permitted;.
149123=The application "{0}" currently has security model "{1}", and an attempt was made to redeploy the application again with a different security model "{2}". The specified security model will be ignored for the current deployment operation. To change the security model, undeploy the application and deploy it again with the new security model.
149124=Failures were detected while initiating {1} task for application "{0}". Error is: "{2}"
149125=No application version was specified for the {0} operation of application "{1}". The {0} operation will be performed against the retired application version "{2}".
149126=No application version was specified for the {0} operation of application "{1}". The application version "{2}" will not be removed as its retirement is still in progress. Oracle recommends that the application version "{2}" be undeployed explicitly after the retirement is done. An explicit undeploy of the application version can also be performed before retirement is done; however, exercise caution as this may interrupt inflight work.
149127=Failures were detected while initiating "{0}" task. Error is: "{1}"
149128=The "{1}" option was specified for the {0} operation of application "{2}". The {0} operation will be performed against the retired application version "{3}".
149129=The "{1}" option was specified for the {0} operation of application "{2}". The {0} operation will be performed against the retiring application version "{3}". Note that retirement is still in progress for version "{3}" and any inflight work will be interrupted.
149130=The "{1}" option was specified for the {0} operation of application "{2}". The {0} operation will be performed against the currently active version "{3}".
149131=Cannot perform operation {2} because application "{0}" is in state {1}
149132=Split directory application {0} can only be deployed on the Administration Server.
149133=Auto-deployed application {0} can only be deployed on the Administration Server.
149134=A redeploy was performed without specifying -source for the archived versioned application "{0}". Partial update of an archived application is not allowed. To perform production redeployment of versioned applications, specify -source with the redeploy operation.
149135=Operation {2} cannot be performed since application "{0}" is not deployed on the target "{1}".
149137={0} is an invalid path for partial redeployment. The URI of the file or directory to be redeployed should be relative to {1}, the root of the enterprise application, or to the standalone module being redeployed.
149138=A subset of the originally configured targets for the application "{0}" was specified. This can potentially lead to out-of-sync applications between the different server targets. The targets specified, "{2}", are different from those of the previous version, "{1}".
149139=Application "{0}" is targeted to cluster "{1}", and provided the target for {3} operation is "{2}". The {3} operation on a subset of the targeted clustered servers is not supported.
149140=The task cannot be processed further until the current edit session is activated. When this occurs, task processing will continue. The user can exit the deployer tool without affecting the task.
149141=The AppDeploymentMBean already exists for application "{0}".
149142=Cluster target "{0}" is configured with no servers, and therefore configuration is updated.
149143=Submodule targets in an application must be specified with the correct module name.
149145=Unable to contact "{0}". Deployment is deferred until "{0}" becomes available. WARNING: If this is a redeploy app and contains JSP pages that have been touched, these JSP changes won't be reflected when the server starts unless precompile is set to true in weblogic.xml
149146=Attempt to reach the Administration Server with alternate URL: "{0}" failed.
149147=Could not reach the Administration Server through any of its URLs: "{0}".
149148=Exception occurred while receiving a message on loopback.
149149=Malformed URL: "{0}".
149150=An IOException occurred while reading the input.
149151=Could not find a registered DeploymentReceiver to handle requests for "{0}".
149152=No deployment request for which to set up the context.
149153=A "prepare" message was received for ID "{0}" that has already been completed or canceled.
149154=A "get deployments response" message was received for ID "{0}" that has no request. It may have already been completed or may have been canceled.
149155=Received "get deployments response" message "{0}" while already handling one. Ignoring the second request.
149156=Illegal state for operation start: "{0}".
149157=There is nothing to do for task "{0}".
149158=No application files exist at "{0}".
149159=There was an attempt to create a staging directory that is null.
149160=There was an attempt to create a staging directory for a null application name.
149161=This operation requires that a target be specified.
149162=This operation requires that a deployment plan be specified.
149163=The domain edit lock is owned by another session in non-exclusive mode. This deployment operation requires exclusive access to the edit lock and therefore cannot proceed. If using "Automatically Aquire Lock and Activate Changes" in the Administration Console, then the lock will expire shortly, so retry this operation.
149164=The domain edit lock is owned by another session in exclusive mode. Therefore, this deployment operation cannot proceed.
149165=Invalid target specified.
149166=Deployments cannot be triggered through configuration updates and through the Deployment APIs simultaneously.
149167=No action was needed to commit the request for "{0}" on "{1}".
149168=Request "{0}" has already been completed or was canceled.
149169=Requires server restart for completion.
149170=Invalid targeting was specified for this operation. Module and submodule targets cannot both be specified for this type of request.
149171=Deferred deployment task: {0}
149172=Deployment request {0} is affecting the system resource {1}, which involves a non-dynamic property {2} in {3}. Therefore, a restart of the resource or the appropriate server targets is required for the changes to be active.
149178=Application "{0}" is targeted to cluster "{1}", and the provided target for {3} operation is "{2}". This can potentially lead to client request problems on the cluster.
149181=Deployment service encountered an error while aborting the edit session before start. Initiator for this edit session is "{0}". Error is "{1}".
149182=An invalid alternate descriptor was specified for the redeploy operation. Alternate descriptors cannot be changed during a redeploy operation.
149183=An invalid retiretimeout option was specified for the deploy operation. The retiretimeout option was specified as "{2}" for the initial deployment of application "{0}". Retirement policies must be set during the deploy or redeploy of the next version in order to apply to version "{1}" of "{0}".
149184=The application "{0}" was autodeployed and may only be redeployed by touching the REDEPLOY file in the domain autodeploy directory for the respected application.
149185=The application "{0}" was autodeployed and may only be deleted by removing the files from the domain autodeploy directory.
149186=The application "{0}" was autodeployed and cannot be redistributed.
149187=An unexpected error occurred when specifying configuration information for the application "{0}" due to {1}.
149188=No application named "{0}" exists for operation {1}. Operation cannot be performed until the server is restarted.
149189=An attempt was made to execute the "{0}" operation on an application named "{1}" that is not currently available. The application may have been created after non-dynamic configuration changes were activated. If so, the operation cannot be performed until the server is restarted so that the application will be available.
149190=Changes are pending from another session whose lock has expired. This deployment operation will not activate changes from another edit session and therefore cannot proceed. Either cancel the edit lock or activate the pending changes using the Administration Console or WLST.
149191=Operation "{0}" on application "{1}" is initializing on "{2}".
149192=Operation "{0}" on application "{1}" is in progress on "{2}".
149193=Operation "{0}" on application "{1}" has failed on "{2}".
149194=Operation "{0}" on application "{1}" has succeeded on "{2}".
149195=Operation "{0}" on application "{1}" has been deferred since "{2}" is unavailable.
149196=Rejecting {1} request for application {0} because {2} request is running for the application.
