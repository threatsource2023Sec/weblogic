2156200=Unable to load descriptor {1} of module {0}. The error is {2}.
2156201=An error occurred while parsing descriptors:\n{0}.
2156202=References were found in the deployment plan for module "{0}" with URI, "{1}". The plan was merged.
2156203=A version attribute was not found in element "{0}" in the deployment descriptor {1}. A version attribute is required, but this version of the WebLogic Server will assume that the latest version is used. Future versions of WebLogic Server will reject descriptors that do not specify the Java EE version. To eliminate this warning, add an appropriate "version=" to element "{0}" in the deployment descriptor.
2156204=The root element {0} is missing in the descriptor file {1}.
2156205=Updating the configuration with the deployment plan overrides for module "{0}" with URI, "{1}".
2156206=No module overrides were found in the deployment plan for module "{0}" with URI, "{1}". If overrides were expected for this module, verify the deployment plan.
2156207=The variable assignment from the deployment plan with variable name "{0}" and XPath "{1}" will be included when overriding the deployment configuration.
2156208=The variable assignment from the deployment plan with variable name "{0}" and XPath "{1}" will be included when overriding the deployment configuration.
2156209=Applying the overrides from the deployment plan for module "{0}" with URI, "{1}".
2156210=Applying the override for variable "{0}" with XPath "{1}" and operation "{2}".
2156211=After applying the overrides from the deployment plan, the descriptor "{0}" is:\n"{1}".
2156212=An error occurred while parsing the specifed XPath "{0}" : {1}.
2156213=An error occurred while parsing the specifed XPath "{0}" : {1}.
2156214=The XPath "{0}" specifies a key selection but the bean "{1}" does not have any keys defined.
2156215=Removed the value matched by the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}".
2156216=The deployment plan operation failed because there was no method named "{0}" on the bean "{1}" corresponding to the element "{2}".
2156217=An error occurred while performing the plan operation for variable "{0}" with element name "{1}" : {2}.
2156218=Updated the element matched by the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}" to have value "{2}".
2156219=Created the element matched by the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}".
2156220=Created the element matched by the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}" to have name "{2}".
2156221=The remove operation for the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}" specified an array index of "{2}" but the array was smaller, so no elements were removed.
2156222=The variable "{0}" specifies a property "{1}" that is a primitive array but no index is specified in the XPath.
2156223=The variable "{0}" for the add operation does not specify a property in the XPath "{1}". This variable assignment has been ignored.
2156224=Added the element matched by the deployment plan variable "{0}" with element name "{1}" with value "{2}".
2156225=The XPath "{0}" contains a trailing invalid "/". It has been ignored. Remove it from the XPath expression.
2156226=Skipping the override for the deployment plan variable "{0}" and XPath "{1}" since the value is not set in the deployment plan.
2156227=The "{0}" deployment descriptor for the "{1}" module is in DTD format. Overrides from the deployment plan will NOT be applied since only deployment descriptors in XML Schema format are supported.
2156228=Updating the configuration with the resource deployment plan overrides for resource "{0}".
2156229=References were found in the resource deployment plan for resource "{0}". The plan was merged.
2156230=No resource overrides were found in the resource deployment plan for resource "{0}". If overrides were expected for this resource, verify the resource deployment plan.
2156231=Applying the overrides from the resource deployment plan for resource "{0}".
