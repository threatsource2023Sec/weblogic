stack080013=false
messagedetail080013=Reference for {0} not found in working set.

action080014=Please contact support at Oracle support to prevent this message from getting logged if debugging is disabled.
stack080015=false
messagedetail080015=The RMI deterministic garbage collector (DGC) mechanism periodically scans through a list of stubs whose lease must be renewed. After scanning through the list, the DGC client sends an RMI call to the server to renew the lease, so that the remote object is not garbage collected.
cause080015=An exception occurred during the execution of the DGC trigger.
action080015=If a java.rmi.NoSuchObjectException occurs, contact My Oracle Support for further analysis of the error.
severity080016=16
stack080016=false
messagedetail080016=No connection available to: {0}. References to objects hosted by {0} will be in jeopardy if lease renewal is required for these objects.
cause080016=The client lost connection to the server {0}. If the server does not receive lease renewal messages on the server, RMI runtime removes the remote objects whose leases are not renewed.

stack080022=false
messagedetail080022=When a remote object gets exported into RMI runtime, it enrolls itself with the deterministic garbage collector (DGC). If the object is already exported, the reference counter is incremented. If the server fails to enroll the remote object, it logs a message.
cause080022=This message is logged when an attempt is made to increment the reference count of a lost reference. The reference may have already been released.
