cause000503=While processing an incoming message an error was encountered. It is likely that the message was corrupted.
action000503=This is most likely a temporary situation. No action is required. If this situation continues, contact My Oracle Support with the server logs and configuration.
messagedetail000504=A message containing an invalid command code was received. This message cannot be processed.
cause000504=A message containing an invalid command code was received. This message cannot be processed. One of the possible reasons is that the message was corrupted in transit.

messagedetail000505=A message containing an invalid heartbeat interval was received. The default heartbeat interval will be used for communication with the peer.
cause000505=The incoming message has an invalid heartbeat interval. This is either due to message corruption in transit or to an invalid choice for the heartbeat interval on the peer that is attempting to establish communication with this JVM.
action000505=If the peer that is attempting to establish communication is overriding the default heartbeat interval, ensure that a valid interval is used. If not, contact My Oracle Support with the server logs and configuration.
