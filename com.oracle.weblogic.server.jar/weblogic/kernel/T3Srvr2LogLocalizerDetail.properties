severity003800=16
messagedetail003800=There was an error when parsing the random seed property passed to the server
cause003800=The seed used to randomize startup services was not parseable. The seed is given to the server with the com.oracle.weblogic.debug.RandomizeServerServices.seed system property.
action003800=Check the value of the com.oracle.weblogic.debug.RandomizeServerServices.seed property given to the server, and make sure it can be parsed into a valid long value
severity003801=16
messagedetail003801=There was an error when parsing the random seed file passed to the server. The file must contain one line that can be parsed into a long to be used as the random seed
cause003801=The seed file used to randomize startup services was not parseable. The name of the seed file is given to the server with the com.oracle.weblogic.debug.RandomizeServerServices.filename system property.
action003801=Check the value of the com.oracle.weblogic.debug.RandomizeServerServices.filename property given to the server, and make sure it points to a file that contains one line that can be parsed into a long which should be used for the random seed
severity003802=64
messagedetail003802=The server service ordering has been randomized with the given seed.
cause003802=The server service randomizer was used to randomize server services with the given seed
action003802=No action necessary
severity003803=16
messagedetail003803=The start service randomizer is in use and the system attempted to write out the random seed to the given file, but there was an error writing the file
cause003803=When using the service randomizer the system attempted to write the seed used to a file for later use, but the system could not write the file
action003803=Ensure that the randomizer file is in a directory where the system can write and that there is enough disk space in that file system
severity003804=16
messagedetail003804=The randomizer file found at the given location is not readable. A randomly generated seed will be used
cause003804=The randomizer file at the given location is not readable
action003804=Ensure that the randomizer file is readable by the system
severity003805=16
messagedetail003805=The randomizer file found at the given location has data in it that cannot be parsed into a long
cause003805=The randomizer file at the given location has bad data in it
action003805=Ensure that the randomizer file has one line that can be parsed into a long value
severity003806=16
messagedetail003806=The stdout or stderr stream will not be redirected and the default JVM stream will continue to work.
cause003806=This is caused due to an I/O error in initializing the new stream.
action003806=Correct the error based on the exception messages reported and restart the server.
severity003807=64
messagedetail003807=WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. The possible modes for this filter are: combine, replace, and disable.
cause003807=The default mode for the filter is combine. It can be overridden via the weblogic.oif.serialFilterMode system property.
action003807=No action is required.
severity003808=64
messagedetail003808=WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. The possible scopes for this filter are: weblogic and global.
cause003808=For recent JDKs, the default scope for the filter is global. It can be overridden via the weblogic.oif.serialFilterScope system property.
action003808=No action is required.
severity003809=64
messagedetail003809=The JDK does not support the JEP 290 filter capability.
cause003809=JEP 290 requires a newer version of the JDK.
action003809=Upgrade to a newer version of the JDK.
severity003810=64
messagedetail003810=WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. Filter elements can specify the maxdepth, maxrefs, maxbytes, and maxarray limits.
cause003810=The default limit for the filter for weblogic scope is maxdepth=100. It can be overridden via the weblogic.oif.serialFilter or weblogic.oif.serialGlobalFilter system properties.
action003810=No action is required.
severity003811=64
messagedetail003811=WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. Filter elements can specify the packages to blacklist.
cause003811=WebLogic Server contains a default set of blacklisted packages. It can be overridden or added to via the weblogic.oif.serialFilter or weblogic.oif.serialGlobalFilter system properties.
action003811=No action is required.
severity003812=64
messagedetail003812=WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. Filter elements can specify the classes to blacklist.
cause003812=WebLogic Server contains a default set of blacklisted classes. It can be overridden or added to via the weblogic.oif.serialFilter or weblogic.oif.serialGlobalFilter system property.
action003812=No action is required.
severity003813=64
messagedetail003813=n WebLogic Server uses a JEP 290 serial filter to restrict deserialization of incoming RMI objects. Filter elements can specify the packages or classes to whitelist.
cause003813=WebLogic Server contains a default empty set of whitelist elements. It can be added to via the weblogic.oif.serialFilter or weblogic.oif.serialGlobalFilter system properties.
action003813=No action is required.
