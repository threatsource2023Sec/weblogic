<a name="Introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This document describes the WebLogic EJB to JSP integration tool. Given an 
  EJB jar file, the tool will generate a JSP tag extension library, whose tags 
  are customized for calling the EJB(s) of that jar file. This document assumes 
  at least some familiarity with both EJB and JSP.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a client, an EJB is described by its remote interface. 
  For example:</p>
<pre>
public interface Trader extends javax.ejb.EJBObject {

  public TradeResult buy(String stockSymbol, int shares);

  public TradeResult sell(String stockSymbol, int shares);

}
</pre>
<p>For web applications that call EJB's, the typical model is to invoke the EJB 
  using java code from within a JSP scriptlet (&lt;% ... %&gt;). The results of 
  the EJB call are then formatted as HTML and presented to the web client. This 
  approach is both tedious and error-prone. The java code required to invoke an 
  EJB is lengthy, even in the simplest of cases, and is typically not within the 
  skill set of most web designers responsible for HTML presentation.</p>
<p>The EJB to JSP tool simplifies invoking an EJB from a JSP page by removing 
  the need for java code. Instead, the EJB is invoked using a JSP tag library 
  that was custom generated for that EJB. For example, the methods of the Trader 
  bean above would be invoked in a JSP like this:</p>
<pre>
&lt;% taglib uri="/WEB-INF/trader-tags.tld" prefix="trade" %&gt;
&lt;b&gt;invoking trade: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;trade:buy stockSymbol="BEAS" shares="100"/&gt;

&lt;trade:sell stockSymbol="MSFT" shares="200"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>The resulting JSP page is cleaner and more intuitive. A tag is (optionally) 
  generated for each method on the EJB. The tags take attributes that are translated 
  into the parameters for the corresponding EJB method call. The tedious machinery 
  of invoking the EJB is hidden, encapsulated inside the handler code of the generated 
  tag library. The generated tag libraries support stateless/stateful session 
  beans, and entity beans. The tag usage scenarios for each of these cases are 
  slightly different, and are described below. </p>

<a name="Basic Operation">
<h2>Basic Operation</h2>
<p>The tool can be run in command-line mode, or else can be run in graphical mode.
  For all but the simplest of EJB's, The graphical tool is preferable.</p>
<p>The graphical tool is invoked like this:</p>
<pre>
  java weblogic.servlet.ejb2jsp.gui.Main
</pre>
<p>Initially, no ejb2jsp project is loaded by the application. A new project may 
  be created by selecting the <b>File -> New</b> menu item, browsing in the file 
  chooser to an EJB jar file, and selecting it. Once initialized, ejb2jsp projects 
  may be modified, saved, and reloaded later for future modification.</p>
<p>The composition of the generated tag library is simple: for each method, of 
  each EJB, in the jar file, a JSP tag is generated, with the same name as the 
  method. Each tag expects as many attributes as the corresponding method has 
  parameters. </p>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="Interface Sources">  
<h2>Interface Source Files</h2> 
<p>When a new EJB jar is loaded, the tool also tries to find the java source files 
  for the home and remote interfaces of your EJB(s). The reason is that, while 
  it can generate tags only by introspecting the EJB classes, it cannot assign 
  meaningful attribute names to the tags whose corresponding EJB methods take 
  parameters. In the <b>Trader</b> example above, when the EJB jar is loaded, 
  the tool will try to find a source file called <b>Trader.java</b>. This file 
  will then be parsed, and it will see that the <b>buy()</b> method takes parameters 
  called <b>stockSymbol</b> and <b>shares</b>. The corresponding JSP tag will 
  then have appropriately named attributes that correspond to the parameters of 
  the <b>buy()</b> method.</p>
<p>When a new EJB jar is loaded, the tool assumes that the source directory is the same
 directory where the EJB jar is located.  If that isn't the case, it isn't a fatal error.
 After the new project is loaded, under the <b>Project Build Options</b> panel, you may
 adjust the <b>EJB Source Path</b> element to reflect the correct directory.  You may
 then select the <b>File -> Resolve Attributes</b> menu to re-run the resolve process.</p>
<p>When looking for java source files corresponding to an interface class, the 
  tool will look in both the directory specified, and in a sub-directory implied 
  by the interface's java package. For example, for <b>my.ejb.Trader</b>, if the 
  directory given is <b>C:/src</b>, the tool will look for both <b>C:/src/Trader.java</b> 
  and <b>C:/src/my/ejb/Trader.java</b>.</p>
<p>Note that access to the source files is not strictly necessary. Attribute names 
  for each tag in a project can always be modified using the tool. However, parsing 
  the source files of the EJB's public interface was developed as the quickest 
  way to assign meaningful attribute names.</p>

<a name="Project Build Options">  
 <h2>Project Build Options</h2>
<p>This panel is used to set all of the parameters related to the local filesystem 
  that are needed to build the project. You may specify the java compiler to use, 
  the java package of the generated JSP tag handlers, and whether or not to keep 
  the generated java code after a project build (this can sometimes be useful 
  for debugging purposes).</p>
<p>This panel is also used to specify the type of tag library output you want. 
  For use in a Java EE web application, a tag library should be packaged one of two 
  ways: as separate class files and a Tag Library Descriptor (.tld) file, or as 
  a single taglib jar file. Either output type is chosen with the <b>Output Type</b> 
  pull-down. For development and testing purposes, <b>DIRECTORY</b> output is 
  recommended, since a web application in WLS must be re-deployed before a jar 
  file may be overwritten.</p>
<p>For either <b>DIRECTORY</b> or <b>JAR</b>, the output locations must be chosen 
  appropriately so that the tag library will be found by a web application. For 
  example, if you wish to use the tag library in a web application rooted in directory 
  <b>C:/mywebapp</b>, then the <b>DIRECTORY classes</b> field should be specified 
  as:</p>
<p> <b>C:/mywebapp/WEB-INF/classes</b></p>
<p>and the <b>DIRECTORY .tld File</b> field should be something like:</p>
<p><b>C:/mywebapp/WEB-INF/trader-ejb.tld</b></p>
<p>The <b>Source Path</b>, described earlier, is edited in the <b>Build Options</b> 
  panel as well. The <b>Extra Classpath</b> field may be used if your tag library 
  depends on other classes not in the core WebLogic server or Java EE API. Typically, 
  nothing will need to be added to this field.</p>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="Resolving Conflicts">  
<h2>Resolving Conflicts</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a project will fail to build because of one or more conflicts. This 
  section describes the reasons for those errors, and how they may be resolved.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Missing build information</b> One of the necessary fields in the <b>Build 
    Options</b> panel is unspecified, like the java compiler, the code package 
    name, or a directory where the output can be saved. The missing field(s) must 
    be filled in before the build can succeed.</li>
  <li><b>Duplicate tag names</b> When an EJB jar is loaded, the tool will record 
    a tag for each method on the EJB, and the tag name will be the same as the 
    method name. If the EJB has overloaded methods (methods with the same name 
    but different signatures), the tag names will conflict. This can be resolved 
    either by renaming one of the tags, or else by disabling one of the tags. 
    To rename a tag, navigate to the tag in question using the tree hierarchy 
    in the left window of the tool. In the tag panel that appears in the right 
    window, modify the <b>Tag Name</b> field. To disable a tag, navigate to the 
    tag in question using the tree hierarchy in the left window of the tool. In 
    the tag panel that appears in the right window, uncheck the <b>Generate Tag</b> 
    box. For EJB jars that contain multiple EJB's, tags for an entire bean may 
    be disabled as well.</li>
  <li><b>Meaningless attribute names arg0, arg1...</b> This error occurs when 
    reasonable attribute names for a tag could not be inferred from the EJB's 
    interface source files. To fix this error, navigate to the tag in question 
    in the project hierarchy tree. Select each of the attribute tree leaves below 
    the tag, in order. For each attribute, assign a reasonable name to the <b>Attribute 
    Name </b>field, in the panel that appears on the right side of the tool.</li>
  <li><b>Duplicate attribute names</b> This occurs when a single tag expecting 
    multiple attributes has two attributes with the same name. Navigate to the 
    attribute(s) in question, and rename attributes so that they are all unique 
    for the tag.</li>
</ul>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="Using Tags">
<h2>Using Tags</h2>
<p>Using the generated EJB tags on a JSP page is simply a matter of declaring 
  the tag library on the page, and then invoking the tags like any other tag extension:</p>
<pre>&lt;% taglib uri=&quot;/WEB-INF/trader-ejb.tld&quot;
 prefix=&quot;trade&quot; %&gt;
&lt;trade:buy stockSymbol=&quot;XYZ&quot; shares=&quot;100&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>For EJB methods that have a non-void return type, a special, optional tag attribute 
  &quot;_return&quot;, is built-in. When present, the value returned from the 
  method is made available on the page for further processing:</p>
<pre>&lt;% taglib uri=&quot;/WEB-INF/trader-ejb.tld&quot;
  prefix=&quot;trade&quot; %&gt;
&lt;trade:buy stockSymbol=&quot;XYZ&quot;
 shares=&quot;100&quot; _return="tr"/&gt;
&lt;% out.println("trade result: " + tr.getShares()); %&gt;</pre>
<p>For methods that return a primitive numeric type, the return variable is a 
  java object appropriate for that type (e.g., &quot;int&quot; -> java.lang.Integer, 
  etc).</p>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="EJB Home Methods">  
<h2>EJB Home Methods</h2>
<p>EJB 2.0 allows for methods on the EJB home that are neither <b>create() </b>or 
  <b>find()</b> methods. Tags are generated for these home methods as well. To 
  avoid confusion, the tool prepends <b>&quot;home-&quot;</b> to the tags for 
  each method on an EJB's home, when a new project is loaded. These methods may 
  be renamed, if desired. </p>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="Stateful Beans">  
<h2>Stateful Session and Entity Beans</h2>
<p>Typical usage of a &quot;stateful&quot; bean is to acquire an instance of the 
  bean from the bean's Home, and then to invoke multiple methods on a single bean 
  instance. This programming model is preserved in the generated tag library as 
  well. Method tags for stateful EJB methods are required to be inside a tag for 
  the EJB's home that corresponds to a <b>find()</b> or <b>create()</b> on the 
  home. All EJB method tags contained within the find/create tag will operate 
  on the bean instance found or created by the enclosing tag. If an method tag 
  for a stateful bean is not enclosed by a find/create tag for its home, a runtime 
  exception occurs. For example, given the following EJB:</p>
<pre>
public interface AccountHome extends EJBHome {

  public Account create(String accountId, double initialBalance);
  public Account findByPrimaryKey(String accountID);
    /* find all accounts with balance above some threshold */
  public Collection findBigAccounts(double threshold);
}
  
public interface Account extends EJBObject {
  public String getAccountID();
  public double deposit(double amount);
  public double withdraw(double amount);
  public double balance();
}
</pre>
<p>Correct tag usage might be as follows:</p>
<pre>
&lt;% taglib uri="/WEB-INF/account-ejb.tld" prefix="acct" %&gt;
&lt;acct:home-create accountId="103"
  initialBalance="450.0" _return="newAcct"&gt;
 &lt;acct:deposit amount="20"/&gt;
 &lt;acct:balance _return="bal"/&gt;
 Your new account balance is: &lt;%= bal %&gt;
&lt;/acct:home-create&gt;
</pre>
<p>If the "_return" attribute is specified for a find/create tag, a page variable 
  will be created that refers to the found/created EJB instance. Entity beans 
  finder methods may also return a collection of EJB instances. Home tags that 
  invoke methods returning a collection of beans will iterate (repeat) over their 
  tag body, for as many beans as are returned in the collection. If "_return" 
  is specified, it is set to the current bean in the iteration:</p>
<pre>
&lt;b&gt;Accounts above $500:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;acct:home-findBigAccounts threshold="500" _return="acct"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Account &lt;%= acct.getAccountID() %&gt;
     has balance $&lt;%= acct.balance() %&gt;
&lt;/acct:home-findBigAccounts&gt;
&lt/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p>The preceding example will display an HTML list of all Account beans whose 
  balance is over $500.</p>
<a href="_top">Top</a>
<a name="Default Attributes">
<h2>Default Attributes</h2>
<p>By default, the tag for each method requires that all of its attributes (method 
  parameters) be set on each tag instance. However, the tool will also allow &quot;default&quot; 
  method parameters to be specified, in case they are not given in the JSP tag. 
  Default attributes/parameters may be specified in the <b>Attribute</b> window. 
  The parameter default can come from an simple <b>EXPRESSION</b>, or if more 
  complex processing is required, a default <b>METHOD</b> body may be written. 
  For example, in the Trader example, suppose we want the &quot;buy&quot; tag 
  to operate on stock symbol &quot;XYZ&quot; if none is specified. In the Attribute 
  panel for the &quot;stockSymbol&quot; attribute of the &quot;buy&quot; tag, 
  we would set the &quot;Default Attribute Value&quot; field to <b>EXPRESSION</b>, 
  and enter &quot;XYZ&quot; (quotes included!) in the <b>Default Expression</b> 
  field. The buy tag will then act as if the stockSymbol=&quot;XYZ&quot; attribute 
  were present, unless some other value were specified. </p>
<p>Or if we wanted the shares attribute of the &quot;buy&quot; tag to be a random 
  number between 0-100, we would set &quot;Default Attribute Value&quot; to <b>METHOD</b>, 
  and in the <b>Default Method Body</b> area, we would write the body of a java 
  method that returns int (the expected type for the &quot;shares&quot; attribute 
  of the &quot;buy&quot; method):</p>
<pre>
long seed = System.currentTimeMillis();
java.util.Random rand = new java.util.Random(seed);
int ret = rand.nextInt();
/* ensure that it is positive...*/
ret = Math.abs(ret);
/* and < 100 */
return ret % 100;
</pre>
<p>Since your default method bodies appear within a JSP tag handler, your code 
  has access to the <b>pageContext</b> variable. From the JSP PageContext, you 
  can gain access to the current HttpServletRequest or HttpSession, and use things 
  like session data or request parameters to generate default method parameters. 
  For example, to pull the &quot;shares&quot; parameter for the &quot;buy&quot; 
  method out of a ServletRequest parameter, you could write the following code:</p>
<pre>
HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest)pageContext.getRequest();
String s = req.getParameter("shares");
if (s == null) {
  /* webapp error handler will redirect to error page
   * for this exception
   */
  throw new BadTradeException("no #shares specified");
}
int ret = -1;
try {
  ret = Integer.parseInt(s);
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
  throw new BadTradeException("bad #shares: " + s);
}
if (ret &lt;= 0)
  throw new BadTradeException("bad #shares: " + ret);
return ret;
</pre>
<p>The generated default methods are assumed to throw Exception.  Any Exceptions raised
during processing will be handled by the JSP's errorPage, or else by the registered
exception handling pages of the web application.</p>
