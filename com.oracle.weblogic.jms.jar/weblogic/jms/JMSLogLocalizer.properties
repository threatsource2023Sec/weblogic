040527=JMS Module "{2}" deployed to {3} defines an entity of type {0} with name "{1}" with default targeting enabled. There is no SAF agent having a persistent store with distribution policy "Distributed" available in {3} to host the entity.

040536=Multiple {1} or/and SAF {1} have been configured with the same name ("{0}") within the same security realm. This potentially may cause those destinations to have the same security policy even if different security policies are specified.
040537=No more than one {1} or SAF {1} has been configured with the same name ("{0}") within the same security realm. A previously detected warning condition has been cleared.
