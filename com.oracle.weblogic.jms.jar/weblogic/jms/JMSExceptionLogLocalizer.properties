045030=The bytes threshold for the JMS server {0} has been exceeded for more than one hour.
045031=The bytes threshold for the JMS server {0} has been exceeded for more than 90 percent of the running time of the server.
045032=While attempting to create destination {1} in module {2} the JMS server {0} could not be found.
045039=An attempt was made to add a JMS entity of an unknown type {1} in the module {0}.
045040=While attempting to add a {1} named {2} in module {0}, an error occurred.
045041=An attempt was made to remove a JMS entity of an unknown type {1} in the module {0}.
045042=An error occurred while adding {1} to the JMS module {0}.
045043=An error occurred while removing {1} from the JMS module {0}.
045045=A subdeployment named {1} was not found in the module {0}.
045047=The SubDeploymentMBean {0} in deployment {1} can only be targeted to one JMSServerMBean because an entity that can only be targeted to a single JMS server (for example a queue, topic or quota) has a sub-deployment-name element with value {0}
045048=The JMS server named {0} has a temporary template configured. The JMSSystemResourceMBean name of the module containing the temporary template is {1}, and the template name is {2}. However, a JMSSystemResourceMBean of name {1} could not be found. The JMS server {0} will not boot until this problem has been fixed.
045049=JMS server {0} does not have a configured temporary template. However an attempt was made to create a temporary destination. This is not allowed.
045050=A destination named {3} has a jms-create-destination-identifier named {1}. However, another destination named {2} has the same jms-create-destination-identifier. Two destinations with the same jms-create-destination-identifier cannot both be located on the JMS server named {0}.
045051=Two destinations with name {1} were deployed to the JMS server {0}.
045052=An attempt was made to change the target of a JMS entity that cannot have its target changed. The entity has name "{0}". The original target has name "{1}". The proposed target has name "{2}"
045054=Cannot dynamically add member {1} to sistributed destination {0}.
045055=Cannot dynamically remove member {1} from distributed destination {0}.
045060=The JMS module named "{0}" is neither an AppDeployment nor a JMSSystemResource.
045061=An attempt was made to create a durable subscription on a queue named "{3}". The client identifier is "{0}", the subscriptionName is "{1}" and the selector is "{2}". Durable subscriptions may only be created on topics.
045062=There can be no more than one jms-interop-module element in the config.xml file.
045063=The jms-interop-module must have name interop-jms and a descriptor file name jms/interop-jms.xml. This has name "{0}".
045064=The target named "{1}" of a JMS module inside a deployment named "{0}" must be a WebLogic Server instance or a cluster. Instead, it is of type "{2}".
045065=A JMS module with fully qualified name "{1}" in an application named "{0}" does not have the proper hierarchy of targets. In particular, the subdeployment named "{2}" has a target "{3}" that is not a subtarget of any of the targets of "{0}". For example, the target "{3}" is not a subtarget of "{4}".
045066=The target named "{1}" of a JMS subdeployment named "{3}" inside a deployment named "{0}" must be a JMS server, WebLogic Server instance, or a cluster. Instead, it is of type {2}.
045067=The field "destination-name" was set to "{3}", in the distributed destination member "{2}", in the distributed destination "{1}", in the module "{0}". The destination-name field of a distributed destination may only be set in the interop module.
045068=The physical destination named "{3}", in the distributed destination member "{2}", in the distributed destination "{1}", in the module "{0}" does not exist.
045069=The JMS module entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" does not exist in the JMSSystemResource "{0}".
045070=The configuration entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" does not exist in the domain "{0}".
045071=The JMS module entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" cannot be created in JMSSystemResource "{0}".
045072=The configuration entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" cannot be created in domain "{0}".
045073=The JMS module entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" cannot be deleted from JMSSystemResource "{0}".
045074=The configuration entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" cannot be deleted from the domain "{0}".
045075=The JMS module managed entity named "{2}" of type "{1}" cannot be found in the JMSSytemResource "{0}" for modification.
045076=An attempt was made to find and modify a JMS module entity 	named "{2}", of type "{1}", from the JMSSystemResource "{0}" 	using a null modifier.
045077=The destination named "{0}" on the JMS server "{1}" would have caused the JMS server not to boot because the destination StoreEnabled value is true, but the JMS server does not have a store.
045078=The destination named "{0}" on the JMS server "{1}" has a DeliveryParamsOverrides.DeliveryMode parameter set to persistent, but the JMS server does not have a store.
045079=An attempt was made to send a persistent message to the destination "{0}" hosted on the JMS server "{1}". This JMS server does not have a store, so the quality of service requested is not available.
045080=The flow steps value {1} is larger than the flow interval value {2} in the connection factory "{0}". The flow steps value must be less than or equal to the flow interval value.
045081=The SessionsMaximum attribute of a JMSSessionPoolMBean has the bad value {0}. The value should be -1 or a positive integer.
045082=An unexpected naming exception occurred while binding the destination "{0}" to the JNDI name "{1}".
045083=An unexpected naming exception occurred while binding the destination "{0}" to the JNDI name "{1}" to the local JNDI context.
045084=An unexpected naming exception occurred while binding the destination "{0}" to the JNDI name "{1}" to the application JNDI context.
045085=Could not find a license for JMS. Contact Oracle to obtain a license.
045086=The jms-system-resource cannot have the name interop-jms.
045087=The JMS deployment "{0}" has the descriptor file name "{1}", which is reserved for internal use only.
045088=The JMS module descriptor file "{1}" used by the JMS system resource "{0}" is illegal. Either the descriptor file name does not end with -jms.xml or the descriptor is being used by another JMS system resource in the configuration.
045089=SAF error destination {2} of {1} is targeted to a different subdeployment from {0}.
045090=The error handling {1} configured for {0} does not exist in the module.
045091=One of the target ("{1}") of the subdeployment "{2}" for the imported destinations "{0}" is not a legal target type.
045092=Imported destinations "{0}": its subdeployment is targeted to a target ("{1}"), which is a receiving-only SAF agent.
045093=A UDQ named "{0}" was found in the JMS interop module. UDQs were not available prior to the 9.0 release of WebLogic Server, and therefore cannot be in the JMS interop module. Create another JMS module and put the UDQ in that module.
045094=A UDT named "{0}" was found in the JMS interop module. UDTs were not available prior to the 9.0 release of WebLogic Server, and therefore cannot be in the JMS interop module. Create another JMS module and put the UDT in that module.
045095=An SAF imported destinanation named "{0}" was found in the JMS interop module. SAF imported destinations were not available prior to the 9.0 release of WebLogic Server, and therefore cannot be in the JMS interop module. Create another JMS module and put the SAF imported destinations in that module.
045096=An SAF remote context named "{0}" was found in the JMS interop module. SAF remote contexts were not available prior to the 9.0 release of WebLogic Server, and therefore cannot be in the JMS interop module. Create another JMS module and put the SAF remote context in that module.
045097=An SAF error handlings named "{0}" was found in the JMS interop module. SAF error handlings were not available prior to the 9.0 release of WebLogic Server, and therefore cannot be in the JMS interop module. Create another JMS module and put the SAF error handlings in that module.
045098=There is a JMS system resource and an application deployment both named "{0}". The names of all JMS system resources and all application deployments must be different.
045099=An attempt was made to create a temporary destination. However, no JMS server in the cluster is able to host temporary destinations. Ensure that at least one of the JMS servers in the cluster has the HostingTemporaryDestinations parameter set to true (which is the default).
045100=The createQueue or createTopic call was made with a null or zero length destination name.
045101=The destination name passed to the createTopic or createQueue "{0}" is invalid. If the destination name does not contain a "/" character, then it must be the name of a distributed destination that is available in the cluster to which the client is attached. If it does contain a "/" character, then the string before the "/" must be the name of a JMS server or a ".". The string after the "/" is the name of a the desired destination. If the "./" version of the string is used then any destination with the given name on the local WebLogic Server instance will be returned.
045102=A destination named "{0}" was not found on WebLogic Server instance "{1}".
045103=While trying to find a topic or a queue, the specific JMS server requested could not be found. The linked exception may contain more information about the reason for failure.
045104=While trying to find a topic or a queue, the specific JMS server requested could not be found.
045105=While trying to find a topic or a queue, communication failed with the specific JMS server requested. The linked exception may contain more information about the reason for failure.
045106=A destination named "{0}" was found. However, the requested destination was of type "{1}", and the destination found was not of that type.
045107=A communication failure occurred while attempting to remove a durable subscription. The linked exception may contain more details about the cause of the failure.
045108=The JMS system does not understand request ID {0}.
045109=A foreign server named "{0}" was found which does not have a connection URL specified. However, it contains a "{2}" named "{1}" that has the same local and remote JNDI name value "{3}". This is an invalid configuration and is not allowed.
045110=The JMS resource named "{0}" has incorrect targeting information. This resource has the default-targeting-enabled attribute set to true and has a valid sub-deployment-name value specified.
045111=The JMS resource named "{0}" has incorrect targeting information. A JMS physical destination cannot have the default-targeting-enabled attribute set.
045112=The flow minimum value {1} is larger than or equal to the flow maximum value {2} in connection factory "{0}". The flow minimum value must be less than the flow maximum value.
045113=JMS distributed destination forward request denied for the destination named "{1}". Reason "{0}".
045114=Failed to unsubscribe the subscription "{0}", client ID "{1}". This connection has a client ID policy of UNRESTRICTED and cannot unsubscribe a durable subscription without a topic object.
045115=The SubDeploymentMBean {0} in JMS Module {1} contains a standalone queue, topic or quota that can only be targeted to a single non-clustered JMS Server or to a clustered JMS Server with Singleton distribution-policy.
045116=The Replicated Distributed Topic (RDT) cannot have its members hosted by a cluster targeted JMSServer. The RDT named {0} in JMS Module {2} has its subdeployment {1} targeted to the Clustered JMSServer {3}.
045119=The current JMS message is a Unit-of-Order (UOO) or Unit-of-Work (UOW) message that cannot be sent to the 	distributed destination (DD) "{0}". This DD has its UnitOfOrderRouting attribute configured to "Hash", which does not support UOO/UOW messages when 	either a DD is configured in a Resource Group scope, or a DD is hosted on a JMS server that is targeted to a cluster. 	To fix this issue: change the UnitOfOrderRouting attribute to "PathService" and ensure a Path Service is configured and running in the current scope.
045120=An injected JMSContext cannot be used when there is neither a transaction nor a valid request scope.
045121=Exception encountered whilst injecting a JMSContext: unable to create InitialContext: {0}
045122=Error injecting JMSContext: unable to lookup connection factory with lookup name {0}. The exception was {1}.
045123=The method {0} is not permitted on a container-managed (injected) JMSContext.
045124=A session mode of SESSION_TRANSACTED is not permitted on a container-managed (injected) JMSContext.
045125=WebLogic JMS extension methods are only available on injected JMSContext objects if the JMS provider being used is WebLogic JMS
045126=WebLogic JMS extension methods are only available on injected JMSContext objects if the JMS provider being used is WebLogic JMS
045127=The application "{1}" has defined a resource using {2} Definition with JNDI name "{0}". There is, however, an object already bound to JNDI using that name.
045128=The application "{1}" has defined duplicate resources using {2} Definition with JNDI name "{0}", but the duplicate resources defined by the application are not compatible.
045129={0} in an application.xml and classes outside of a module, is allowed to define a resource only in java:global and java:app namespaces. the application "{1}" has, however, defined a {0} with the name "{2}", which is not valid.
045130=The application "{1}" has defined a {0} resource with name "{2}" in a namespace that is not a well-defined namespace by the Java EE specification. The {0} resource is allowed only in one of the JNDI namespaces - java:global, java:app, java:module and java:comp.
045131=The application "{0}" has specified one or more properties to define a {1} resource. The value set for a property specified by {2} does not, however, match the value expected by WebLogic.
045132=The application "{0}" has defined a {1} resource using {2} and specified a property "{3}" with value "{4}", which is not the expected type for that property.
045133=The Uniform Distributed Queue/Topic cannot be hosted by a cluster targeted JMSServer that does not have its distribution-policy set to Distributed. The UDQ/UDT named {0} in JMS Module {2} has its subdeployment {1} targeted to the Clustered JMSServer {3}.
045134=JMS Module "{3}" deployed to {4} defines an entity of type {1} with name "{2}" and with default targeting option enabled. There are more than one JMS servers "{5}", having a persistent store with distribution policy "{0}" available in {4} to host the entity, which is not allowed.
045135=JMS Module "{2}" deployed to {3} defines an entity of type {0} with name "{1}" and with default targeting option enabled. There are more than one SAF agents "{4}", having a persistent store with distribution policy "Distributed" available in {3} to host the entity, which is not allowed.
045136=The JMS Server with name "{0}" specified by the property jms-server-name of {1} with JNDI name "{2}" in application {3} is not available in the {4}.
045137=Weighted (Non-Uniform) Distributed Destination/Destinations configured under a JMS module "{0}" are not supported because JMS module "{0}" exists under "{1}". Weighted (Non-Uniform) Distributed Destination are not supported in the Resource Group or Resource Group Template scopes.
045138=A Uniform Distributed Topic "{0}" in JMS module "{1}" is configured with a forwarding policy "Replicated". This policy is unsupported in a Resource Group or Resource Group Template scope and the JMS module "{1}" is configured under "{2}"
045139=The JMS Server with name "{0}" specified by the property jms-server-name of JMS Destination Definition with JNDI name "{1}" in application {2} has a persistent store with distribution policy "{3}". A JMS Server with a store having distribution policy "Distributed" is only allowed to host the destination defined by JMS Destination Definition.
045140=Error using a JMSContext object that was injected using @Inject. The JNDI name {0} specified in the @JMSConnectionFactory annotation does not refer to a javax.jms.ConnectionFactory or javax.jms.XAConnectionFactory, it refers to a {1}.
045141=Error using a JMSContext object that was injected using @Inject. Unable to look up the connection factory using the JNDI name {0} that was specified in the @JMSConnectionFactory annotation.
045142=WebLogic Server has detected a deprecated JMS Interop Module in your configuration. This feature will be removed in a future release. Oracle recommends that you take appropriate measures to remove dependencies on JMS Interop Modules.
045143=The Subdeployment "{0}" in JMS Module "{1}" contains a standalone Queue or standalone Topic that can only be targeted to the JMS Server/JMS Servers that references a store configured with "Singleton" distribution-policy.
045144=The SubDeployment "{0}" in JMS Module "{1}" contains a Distributed Queue or Distributed Topic that can only be targeted to the JMS Server/JMS Servers that references a Store configured with "Distributed" distribution-policy.
045145=The URL "{0};" references a WebLogic MT partition, but WebLogic JMS Client for Microsoft .NET does not support partitions.
045146=Destination "{0};" with JNDI name "{1};" is scoped to a WebLogic MT partition, but WebLogic JMS Client for Microsoft .NET do not support partitons.
045147=ConnectionFactory "{0};" is scoped to a WebLogic MT partition, but WebLogic JMS Client for Microsoft .NET does not support partitons.
045148=JMS Destination Definition with JNDI name "{0}" defined in the application "{1}" which is deployed to {2} will not be hosted as there are more than one JMS Servers having a persistent store with distribution policy "Distributed" available.
045149=The application "{0}" has defined a {1} resource with name "{3}" using {2} in an application client module "{4}" and specified a resource adapter "{5}".
045150=The target named "{1}" of an SAF imported destination named "{3}" inside a deployment named "{0}" must be an SAF agent, WebLogic Server instance, or a cluster. Instead, it is of type {2}.
045151=The target named "{1}" of an SAF imported destination named "{3}" inside a deployment named "{0}" must be an SAF agent. Instead, it is of type {2}.
045152=The JMS Module "{1}" deployed to {2} defines a Foreign Server with name "{0}" and is targeted to subdeployment {3}. The subdeployment {3} is, however, targeted to a JMS Server with distribution policy "Singleton", which is not allowed to be used as a target for a Foreign Server.
045153=The JMS resource with JNDI name "{2}" defined using {0} by the application "{1}" does not have proper hierarchy of targets. "{3}" specified by property jms-server-name is not a subtarget of "{4}".
045154=A Uniform Distributed Destination can only be targeted to a JMS Server that is in the same Resource Group or Resource Group Template scope as the uniform distributed destination. JMS Server "{0}" is not in the same scope as the destination.
045155=There is scope conflict. Either a naming context is attached to a pre-12.2.1 WebLogic Server but the scope type is Resource Group or Resource Group Template (the Domain scope type is the only valid type in this case), or a naming context is attached to a partition but the scope type is Domain or a Resource Group Template (the Resource Group scope type is the only supported type in this case).
045156=Could not find partition name in the given "Context" Object.
045157={0} named "{1} " does not exist in the {2} scope.
045158=A {0} named "{1} " does not exist in the Resource Group or Resource Group Template {2}.
045159=A {0} "{1}" does not exist under {2}.
045160=The Target name "{0}" is not allowed in {1} scope. Target name must be null in Resource Group/Resource Group Template scope and It should not be null for Domain scope.
045161=Parameter {0} can't be null or empty.
045162=Operation "{0}" cannot be invoked in Resource Group or Resource Group Template scope.
045163=Targets of Uniform Distributed Destination deployment overlap. JMS Server named: " {0} " is been identified twice as potential JMSServer for hosting the Uniform Distributed Destionation's members under the Uniform Distributed.
045164=Invalid partition name: the given partition Name {0} does not exist under {1}.
045165=Object-based security is enabled on the JMS connection factory with JNDI name "{0}", therefore it can only be used by a 12.2.2.1.0 or later client.
045166=The InitialContextFactory {0} is not supported by Foreign Server.
045167=The proposed JNDI name {0} for destination {1} is already bound by another object of type {2}. {3}
045168=Connection is closed because {0} is shutting down.
045169=The method "{0}" is not supported in {1} scope. The scope type should be Resource Group.
045170=A JMS module has an incorrectly configured store-and-forward (SAF) error handler named "{0}". The error handler is configured with a "Redirect" error handling policy, and this policy requires an explicitly configured error destination in the error handler, where the error destination must not be the same as any of the destinations that use the error handler.
