200000=Failed to initialize the messaging bridge service.
200001=The messaging bridge service has successfully shut down.
200002=Failed to deploy the messaging bridge "{0}" because the messaging bridge service is shut down.
200003=Failed to deploy the messaging bridge "{0}" due to error: {1}.
200004=The messaging bridge "{0}" has been successfully deployed.
200005=Failed to start messaging bridge "{0}" due to error: {1}
200008=Bridge "{0}" does not have a configured source destination.
200009=Bridge "{0}" does not have a configured target destination.
200011=The bridge "{0}" failed to find the adapter "{1}". The bridge will periodically retry to look up the adapter. If this message stops reappearing, it means that the bridge has finally successfully found the adapter.
200012=Bridge "{0}" successfully found the adapters that are configured for it.
200013=Invalid properties are defined for the source destination of bridge "{0}".
200014=Invalid properties are defined for the target destination of bridge "{0}".
200015=An error occurred in bridge "{0}" during the transfer of messages ({1}).
200020=Bridge "{0}" is stopped.
200021=Bridge "{0}" failed to get one of the adapters from JNDI ({1}).
200022=Bridge "{0}" failed to obtain adapter metadata ({1}).
200024=Bridge "{0}" refused to obtain connections and transfer any messages, because it has been stopped, suspended, or is shutting down.
200025=Bridge "{0}" failed to start because the quality of service configured ({1}) is unreachable. This is likely due to an invalid configuration or adapter limitations.
200026=Bridge "{0}" encountered problems in one of its adapters or underlying systems. It stopped transferring messages and will try to reconnect to the adapters shortly. (The exception that occurred was {1})
200027=Bridge "{0}" works in asynchronous mode and has not received messages for the predefined maximum idle time. The connections to the adapters will be interrupted and reestablished.
200028=The bridge "{0}" has started transferring messages.
200030=Bridge "{0}" is configured to work in "{1}" mode, but it is actually working in "{2}" mode.
200031=Bridge "{0}" is configured to allow degradation of its quality of service in cases where the configured quality of service cannot be reached.
200032=Bridge "{0}" is configured to disallow degradation of its quality of service in cases where the configured quality of service is unreachable.
200033=Bridge "{0}" is obtaining connections to the two adapters.
200034=Bridge "{0}" is shut down.
200035=Bridge "{0}" has been started from the stopped mode.
200036=The started attribute of bridge "{0}" has been changed from "{1}" to "{2}".
200037=The "{1}" attribute of bridge "{0}" has been changed from "{2}" to "{3}".
200038=Bridge "{0}" is inactive because it is configured to be stopped.
200039=Bridge "{0}" has the same destination as its source and target.
200040=Bridge destination {0}: connection URL cannot be null if the initial context factory is not weblogic.jndi.WLInitialContextFactory.
200041=Bridge destination {0}: a bridge destination for JMS must have a connection factory JNDI name and a destination JNDI name configured.
200042=Bridge {0} failed to connect to the source destination and will try again in {2} seconds. This could be a temporary condition unless the messages repeat several times. ({1})
200043=Bridge "{0}" failed to connect to the target destination and will try again in {2} seconds. This could be a temporary condition unless the messages repeat several times. ({1})
200044=The following exception has occurred: \n
200045=Bridge "{0}" failed to start because it has been suspended or is shutting down.
200046=The "{1}" attribute of bridge "{0}" has been changed from "{2}" to "{3}".
200047=Bridge "{0}" failed to start because its migratable target has not been activated for this server.
200048={1} destination "{2}" of bridge "{0}" has a configured adapter JNDI name "{3}", so it will find the internal automatically deployed adapter with JNDI name "{4}". The bridge will ignore an explicitly configured and deployed adapter with adapter JNDI name "{3}". The deployed adapter will be ignored, the bridge does not need to deploy a separate adapter.
200049={1} destination "{2}" of bridge "{0}" uses a custom adapter JNDI name "{3}" instead of the expected names of eis.jms.WLSConnectionFactoryJNDIXA or eis.jms.WLSConnectionFactoryJNDINOXA.
200050=The bridge has a configured adapter JNDI name "{1}", so it will find the internal automatically deployed adapter with JNDI name "{2}". The bridge will ignore an explicitly configured and deployed adapter "{0}". The deployed adapter will be ignored.
