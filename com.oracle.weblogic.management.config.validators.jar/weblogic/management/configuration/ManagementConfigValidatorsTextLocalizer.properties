checkBlackListRes=Resource Group {0} contains resources {1} that do not support multiple targets.

checkDirectTargOfRes={0} contains resource groups with resources that are targeted but should not be.
checkDeploymentNameNotContainDollarSign=The name of {0} deployed to a partition must not contain a $ because it may conflict with a partion named {1}.
checkAmbiguousResName=The partition name of {0} conflicts with the resource {1} that ends with ${2}. Either change the partition name or the resource name so there is no conflict.
checkTargetNotSetForOtherGlobalRG=The target {0} already exists as a Target in ResourceGroup {1}. Two Partitions, or a Partition and a global Resource Group, cannot share the same Virtual Target.
checkTargetNotSetForOtherPartition=The target {0} already exists as an AvailableTarget in Partition {1}. Two Partitions, or a Partition and a global Resource Group, cannot share the same Virtual Target.
checkTargetAlreadyExists=The target {0} already exists as an AvailableTarget in Partition {1}
checkAddDefTarget=Cannot add {0} as a DefaultTarget because AvailableTargets for Partition {1} does not contain this. First add {0} to AvailableTargets and then add it as a DefaultTarget",
checkRemoveAvailTarget=Cannot remove {0} from {1}, as {0} is a default Target either in the Partition or one of its ResourceGroups
checkParentNotFound=Cannot identify the parent of {0}
checkDelTargetWhenRGisRunning=Cannot remove the target(s) {0} while the ResourceGroup {1} is running, first stop the resource group and then remove the target(s)
