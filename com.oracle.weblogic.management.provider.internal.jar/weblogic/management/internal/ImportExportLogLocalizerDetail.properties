messagedetail213500=The ResourceDeploymentPlanPath for Partition {0} is set to {1} but the exported zip file does not contain the Plan itself.
cause213500=While importing the paritition, an attempt was made to import a partition without proper configuration. The element resource-deployment-plan-path 	 points to a plan which is to be used for overwriting resource attributes. 	 As part of exporting a partition, this plan should have been archived as part of the overall partition archive created, but the exported archive is missing the plan.
action213500=Export the partition once again and verify that the exported archive ZIP file contains the file referred to by <resource-deployment-plan-path > in config.xml before importing the partition.
messagedetail213501=While trying to export a partition, the provided partition name does not exist in the current domain.
cause213501=The partition name that was provided for export does not exist in the domain.
action213501=Check the name of the partition and then run exportPartition again.
messagedetail213502=While doing importPartition, if the parameter createNew is null, and the domain into which the partition is imported contains a ResourceGroupTemplate with the same name as is being referenced by the partition being imported, then it is advisable to run importPartition again and indicate whether to reuse the existing ResourceGroupTemplate or clone the ResourceGroupTemplate being imported with a new name.
cause213502=This error occurs if importPartition is called with the createNew parameter set to null, and the partition being imported references a ResourceGroupTemplate that has the same name as one of the ResourceGroupTemplates in the domain.
action213502=If you want to use the existing ResourceGroupTemplate, run importPartition again with createNew set to false. If you want to clone the ResourceGroupTemplate with a new name, run importPartition again with createNew set to true.
messagedetail213503=TBD
cause213503=During import, if the option createNew is set to false, then it is imperative that the files corresponding to the ResourceGroupTemplate copied into the pending directory as part of import be deleted before activate is called.
action213503=Delete the file {0} and run importPartition again.
messagedetail213504=TBD
cause213504=While importing a partition with the application binaries/plan, the destination for writing the binary/plan file in an imported domain file system already has a file with the same name.
action213504=Delete the file in the domain at {1} and run importPartition again.
messagedetail213505=During import, if the partition has an app-deployment reference and the application binaries are not present in the exported ZIP file, it is assumed 	 that you will provide the application binaries at the specified location. 	 This usually is the case for NOSTAGE or EXTERNAL_STAGE staged applications.
cause213505=The imported partition references an application that is neither in the exported ZIP file nor at the specified location as specified by the source-path attribute of the app-deployment bean.
action213505=Check that source-path is correct and run importPartition again after placing the application binary at the specified source-path.
messagedetail213506=During import, if the imported partition has a reference to app-deployment and that app-deployment stage is set to {1}, then it is imperative that 	 you export the partition with the application binaries so that it is available for import.
cause213506=The imported partition references an application that is in {1} staged mode. The exported ZIP file does not, however, contain the application binary.
action213506=Either change the staging mode in the attributes.json file to external_stage/nostage or export again with the application binaries included.
messagedetail213507=importPartition provides the flexibility to change attributes on configuration mbeans by providing <partitionName>-attributes.json file. All the configuration changes in this file override the ones in config.xml 	 during import. If you specify a reference attribute value that does not exist in the domain, then this error is thrown. For example, if you are importing 	 a partition into a domain with a virtual target named "vt1" and 	 the you change attributes.json to have the partition's available-targets 	 as "vt2", because "vt2" does not exist in the domain 	 being imported, an error is thrown during importPartition.
cause213507=A wrong attributes value was specified in the attributes.json file during importPartition.
action213507=Look at config.xml before importing and use the proper attribute values for updating attributes.json before importing the partition.
messagedetail213508=You are not allowed to change the name of the attributes in the attributes.json file because hanging the name dies not allow WebLogic 	 Server to find which attributes were changed when comparing them 	 with partition-config.xml.
cause213508=The name of an attribute was changed in {2}.
action213508=Revert the name change in {2} and importPartition again.
messagedetail213509=TBD
cause213509=The partition being exported is in an unknown state. A common cause of this is that a non-dynamic configuration change was made to the domain that has deferred the initialization of the partition until the Administration Server is restarted.
action213509=Restart the Administration Server.
