cause050002=A non-serializable object cannot be serialized.
action050002=If the object was not intended to be replicated, set the replicate bindings to false. If the object should be replicated to all nodes in the cluster, ensure that the object is serializable or externalizable.

stack050006=false
messagedetail050006=An attempt was made to look up the versioned object "{0}" from an external client or another application. This can potentially cause in-flight work of the application version not being tracked properly, and thus, be retired prematurely.
cause050006=An attempt was made to look up the versioned object "{0}" from an external client or another application. This can potentially cause in-flight work of the application version not being tracked properly, and thus, be retired prematurely.
action050006=Ensure that the possibility of premature retirement of the application version is either tolerated or handled properly. To disable this check, set the JNDI environment property as specified by weblogic.jndi.WLContext.ALLOW_EXTERNAL_LOOKUP to "true" when performing lookup of the versioned object.
severity050007=16
stack050007=false
messagedetail050007=An attempt was made to look up the non-versioned global resource "{0}" from an application version "{1}". This can potentially cause conflict of the global resource usages among multiple application versions.
cause050007=An attempt was made to look up the non-versioned global resource "{0}" from an application version "{1}". This can potentially cause conflict of the global resource usages among multiple application versions.
action050007=Ensure that usages of the global resource by multiple application versions do not conflict. To disable this check, set the JNDI environment property as specified by weblogic.jndi.WLContext.ALLOW_GLOBAL_RESOURCE_LOOKUP to "true" when performing lookup of the global resource.
severity050008=16

messagedetail050008=Illegal cross partition JNDI lookup detected for "{0}" from source context "{1}" to destination context "{2}".
cause050008=An attempt was made to access the "{0}", the current partition is "{1}" but the target partition is "{2}". This cross partition should be taken care of by visibility control.
action050008=Either configure "{0}" to allow cross partition access or modify the application to avoid cross partition lookup. For example, you can use a remote (host:port) url to target the destination.
