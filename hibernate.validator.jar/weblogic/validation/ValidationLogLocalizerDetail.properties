cause2156400=The file does not conform to the JSR 303 specification. This maybe because the file is intended to configure another validation framework or because of a typo in the file.
action2156400=JSR 303 specifies the location of the validator descriptor as either WEB-INF for web application or META-INF for all other cases. A validation.xml file at that location should only be used for the purpose of configuring javax.validation. If the purpose of the file is to configure another validation framework, consider using a different name or placing the file in a different location.
