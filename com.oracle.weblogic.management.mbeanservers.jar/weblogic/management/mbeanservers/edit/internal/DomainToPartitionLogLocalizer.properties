2194801=The archive file name {0} specified for importPartition is null
2194802=Partition name cannot be null, please specify a partition name.
2194803=A Path Service targeted to a cluster requires High Availability Policies set on that Cluster, so MigrationBasis must be set in the Cluster "{0}". If database is chosen as MigrationBasis, then DataSourceForAutomaticMigration must be set. When consensus leasing is chosen as MigrationBasis, all servers that belong to the cluster must have a machine set and node manager configured for that machine.
2194804=A domain partition with the name "{0}" already exists. Please specify a name for the partition which is not already configured in the given domain.
2194805=The domain archive "{0}" is empty, specify a valid domain archive for import operation.
2194806=The domain archive "{0}" and/or the associated json file is not compatible with the current version of importPartition. Please generate the archive using the current Domain To Partition Conversion Tool. If the generated json file is modified to remove the resource-group entries please correct it.
2194807=Cannot find realm "{0}" in the domain configuration.
2194808=The exiting virtual-target {0} is not for target {1}.
2194809=Cannot create a virtual target with the name "{0}" as the server "{1}" is a member of the cluster "{2}"!
2194810=Cannot add "{0}" to available targets of the domain partition as the server "{1}" is a member of the cluster "{2}".
2194811=The target "{0}" of virtual-target "{1}" does not exist in the target domain.
2194812=Cannot find Virtual Target "{0}" to add as an available target.
2194813=Cannot find Virtual Target "{0}" to add as the default target.
2194814=Virtual Target with the name "{0}" is not available, to set as target for the resource group "{1}"!
2194815=Virtual Target with the name "{0}" is not one of the available targets in the partition "{1}"!
2194816=Resource Group Template "{0}" already exists in the domain.
2194817=JMS Server "{0}" is referencing a persistence store "{1}" with distribution policy 'Singleton', as it is hosting one or more standalone destinations. However the same persistence store is referenced by SAF Agent "{2}", which requires the persistence store to have distribution policy 'Distributed'. This conflict is not allowed, so JMS Server and SAF Agent should not refer the same persistence store.
2194818=The "{0}" element in the json generated by the Domain TO Partition Conversion Tool is not an JSON Array. If the json file is modified before import, please correct the issue and try import again.
2194819=Cannot add the Virtual Target "{0}" to available targets of the domain partition as the server "{1}" is a member of the cluster "{2}".
2194820=The destination for writing the imported application "{0}" already exists at {1}.
2194821=The imported zip file does not contain the application plan at "{0}".
2194822=The imported zip file does not contain the application/library source at "{0}".
2194823=The destination for writing the imported plan for application "{0}" already exists at {1}.
2194824=Import of "{1}" of type "{0}" is excluded in the json file, an excluded resource won't be available in the partition.
2194825=Partition "{0}" already contains a default target with the name "{1}".
2194826=Cannot find/set JDBCStore "{0}" to JMS Server "{1}".
2194827=Removing the target "{1}" from the subdeployment "{0}", to retain the first target for the subdeployment.
2194828=Modifying the distribution policy to 'Singleton' and the migration policy to 'Always' of the persistent store "{0}" referenced by the Path Service "{1}".
2194829=Path Service "{0}" in the source domain was pointing to default store. So creating a file store with the name "{1}" under Resource Group / Resource Group Template "{2}" as a path service without a valid store is not supported in a partitioned environment.
2194830=The importPartition operation failed to create the report.
2194831=The importPartition operation completed.
2194832=The activation of importPartition failed with the error - {0}
2194833=Error creating the JDBC Store "{0}", cannot find and set JDBC SystemResource "{1}"
2194834=The JDBC Store "{0}" in the source domain does not have an associated JDBC System Resource. So this JDBC Store won't be created in the target domain partition. Any reference to this JDBC Store by a JMS Server or a SAF Agent or a Path Service will result in a validation exception due to unresolved reference in the configuration (config.xml).
2194835=The Uniform Distributed Topic "{0}" in JMS Module "{1}" is configured to use the forwarding policy 'Replicated'(the default). This configuration is not supported when importing this domain to a partition, so the forwarding policy will be changed to 'Partitioned'.
2194836=The subdeployment "{0}" in JMS Module "{1}" is targeted to "{2}" of type "{3}". This configuration is not supported. Subdeployments when not targeted to a JMS Server or a SAF Agent, will be left untargeted and any resources that reference that subdeployment will not be deployed.
2194837=The subdeployment "{0}" in JMS Module "{1}" is targeted to "{2}" of type "{3}" and "{2}" is associated with a specific server in cluster "{4}" via a target of "{5}" of type "{6}". Partition scoped JMS destinations do not support targeting a particular Server or Migratable Target, so, after import, this subdeployment will be targeted to a JMS Server or a SAF Agent with an effective target of a Cluster, the destination runtime will therefore be hosted on a single random server in the cluster, or across all members of the cluster depending on its distribution policy and the server hosting the destination may change after failures or restarts.
2194838=The subdeployment "{0}" in JMS module "{1}" does not have any valid target. After import, any JMS destination that refer this subdeployment will not be deployed.
2194839=Unable to undo the changes which are not activated. Cause: {0}
2194840=JMS Server "{0}" is found to be hosting one or more standalone destinations as well as Uniform Distributed Destinations using subdeployments. 			As the required Distribution Policy to host these destinations conflict, 			this is not allowed by Domain To Partition Conversion Tool(D-PCT).
2194841=JMS Server "{0}" is found to be hosting one or more standalone destinations as well as Foregin Server using subdeployments. 			As the required Distribution Policy to host these destinations conflict, 			this is not allowed by D-PCT.
2194842=The library file "{0}" available at 			"{1}" is used; the source library is ignored.
2194843=The target "{0}" is invalid or not found in the target 			domain. Please provide a JMSServer/SAF-Agent target name that exists.
