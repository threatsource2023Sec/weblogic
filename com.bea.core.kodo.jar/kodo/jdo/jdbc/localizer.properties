bad-poly-extension: Uncrecognized value "{1}" for the nonpolymorphic mapping \
	extension on "{0}".  Legal values are ''exact'', ''joinable'', ''false''.
bad-col-extension: Unrecognized column extension "{0}" in "{1}".  Valid \
	column extensions are: {2}
export: Exporting mapping information for type "{0}".
write-export: Writing the exported data.
import: Importing file "{0}".
store-import: Storing imported data in the mapping factory.
bad-length-scale: "{0}" declares a column with name "{1}" that has a bad \
	length or scale value of "{2}".  Lengths and scales must be integers.
not-supclass-field: Field "{0}" cannot be mapped by "{1}", because "{2}" is \
	not a valid class, or is not a superclass of that type.
invalid-field: Field "{0}" is not declared in "{1}".
no-mapping-resolve: "{0}" cannot be stored until its mapping is resolved.
dep-embed-coll: "{0}" declares an embedded element, but the old mapping \
	syntax does not support embedded persistence-capable elements.  To \
	map this field, either remove the embedded-element attribute, \
	or migrate to JDOR mapping syntax.
dep-embed-map: "{0}" declares an embedded key or value, but the old mapping \
	syntax does not support embedded persistence-capable keys or values.  To \
	map this field, either remove the embedded-key/embedded-value attribute, \
	or migrate to JDOR mapping syntax.
no-mapping: No mapping information found for type "{0}".
no-type-info: The mapping type to use is not set for "{0}".
bad-mapping-ref: The mapping table could not be created: {0}
bad-mapping-read: Attempt to read the mapping table failed; continuing \
	on the assumption that the table has not been created yet, and there is \
	no data to read: {0}
bad-mapping-drop: Attempt to drop a mapping failed; continuing on the \
	assumption that the table has not been created yet, and there is \
	no data to drop: {0}
bad-mapping-write-1: First attempt to write to the mapping table failed; will \
	attempt to create the table in case it has been dropped before re-trying: \
	{0}
bad-mapping-write-2: Attempt to write the mapping table for the second \
	time failed.  See previous log messages for possible reasons.
make-mapping-table: Creating table to hold mapping information.
drop-mapping-table: Dropping mapping table.
mappingtable-usage: Usage: java kodo.jdo.jdbc.TableJDORMappingFactory\n\
	\t[-properties <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]\n\
	\t-action/-a <add | drop>
dep-mappingtable-usage: Usage: \
	java kodo.jdo.jdbc.TableDeprecatedJDOMappingFactory\n\
	\t[-properties <properties file or resource>]\n\
	\t[-<property name> <property value>]\n\
	\t-action/-a <add | drop>
conn-forbid: The method "{0}" is forbidden by the JDO spec.  To use these \
	methods, cast this instance to a kodo.jdo.jdbc.JDBCJDOConnection \
	and use getDelegate() to retrieve the underlying connection.
