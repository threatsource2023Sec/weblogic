batch-not-supported: The update count for the statement was an invalid \
    value ({0}). This indicates that your database or JDBC driver does not \
    have complete support for executing batch statements. Batch \
    functionality should be disabled by including "BatchLimit=0" in \
    your openjpa.jdbc.DBDictionary configuration property. Statement: {1}
ref-cycle: An unresolvable constraint cycle was detected.  This typically \
    means that a mapping in a table other than the class'' primary table has \
    a foreign key that is part of a circular foreign key dependency.  OpenJPA \
    sometimes cannot meet circular dependencies when some of the involved \
    mappings are in secondary tables.
update-failed-no-failed-obj: Database operation failed. Update count for SQL \
    statement was {0}. Statement: {1}
press-key-end: Server running.  Press enter to stop.
no-server-conf: There is no persistence server configured.
server-usage: Usage: \
    java org.apache.openjpa.jdbc.kernel.StartPersistenceServer\n\
        \t[-properties/-p <properties file or resource>]\n\
        \t[-<property name> <property value>]* 
del-ins-cycle: An unresolvable constraint cycle was detected.  This typically \
    means that you are persisting a new object with the same primary key value \
    as an object you are deleting in the same transaction, and at the same \
    time you have circular foreign key dependencies in the transaction.  The \
    combination of these two factors can sometimes lead to a situation in \
    which OpenJPA cannot meet all the database constraints.
