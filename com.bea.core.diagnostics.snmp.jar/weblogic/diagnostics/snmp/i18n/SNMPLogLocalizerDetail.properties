action320931=No action is required.
messagedetail320937=A runtime error occurred during the sending of an SNMP message over TCP/IP, possibly due to a networking or configuration error.
cause320937=This is an internal WebLogic Server error that occurred during the sending of an SNMP message using the TCP transport provider.
action320937=Contact My Oracle Support.
messagedetail320938=The SNMP Agent provides a read-only view of the MBeanServer. It is not possible to make configuration changes using SNMP.
cause320938=You attempted to set an MBean attribute using SNMP.
action320938=Use JMX APIs to update the WLS configuration MBeans.
messagedetail320939=The SNMP table row corresponding to the given MBean instance could not be added.
cause320939=This could be due to a row already existing in the SNMP Agent for the MBean or an error condition in the SNMP Agent.
action320939=Take appropriate action based on additional information in the error stack trace.
messagedetail320940=The SNMP table row corresponding to the given MBean instance could not be deleted.
cause320940=The specified MBean instance was not registered in SNMP or it could be due to an error condition in the SNMP Agent.
action320940=Take appropriate action based on additional information in the error stack trace.
messagedetail320941=When a dedicated Network Access Point has been configured for the SNMP protocol, SNMP packets will only be accepted and processed over the dedicated channel(s) (in addition to the SNMP Agent's configured UDP port).
cause320941=This occurs when a dedicated Network Access Point for SNMP traffic has been configured and activated and an SNMP request is received over the default server channel.
action320941=Direct the SNMP request to the configured channel.
messagedetail320942=This error is thrown during validation for an SNMPJMXMonitorMBean or an SNMPAttributeChangeMBean configuration.
cause320942=The specified name is not recognized as a valid WebLogic Server MBean type.
action320942=Please specify the correct name for a WebLogic Server Configuration or Runtime MBean type.
messagedetail320943=This error is thrown during validation for an SNMPJMXMonitorMBean or an SNMPAttributeChangeMBean configuration.

action320943=Please specify the correct attribute name for the WebLogic Server Configuration or Runtime MBean type.
messagedetail320944=When the SNMP Agent's trap version is set to V3, the security name must be specified.
cause320944=The SNMP Agent's trap version is set to V3 and the SecurityName is not specified for the given SNMPTrapDestination.
action320944=Please specify the SecurityName attribute for which the SNMP Agent will issue V3 traps.
messagedetail320945=The SNMP Agent sends INFORM notifications instead of traps only when the SNMPTrapVersion is V2 or higher.
cause320945=The SNMPAgentMBean's SNMPTrapVersion attribute is set to V1.
action320945=Set the SNMPTrapVersion to V2 or higher in the configuration.
messagedetail320946=Only one SNMPAgentDeployment instance can be targeted to a given server.
cause320946=An attempt was made to target multiple SNMPAgentDeploymentMBeans to the same WebLogic Server instance.
action320946=Ensure that only one SNMPAgentDeploymentMBean is targeted to any Server in the domain.
messagedetail320947=It is invalid to have a privacy protocol without specifying an authentication protocol.
cause320947=An invalid combination of authentication and privacy protocols was configured.
action320947=Specify either MD5 or DES as the AuthenticationProtocol in combination with Privacy.
messagedetail320948=The Security Level for all the SNMP users is implicitly defined by configuring the AuthenticationProtocol and the PrivacyProtocol attributes on the SNMPAgentMBean. The global security level for all the users should be a level equal to or greater than the security level specified by the SNMPTrapDestination target. If the target specifies noAuthNoPriv, then any valid combination of AuthenticationProtocol and the PrivacyProtocol attributes on the SNMPAgentMBean is allowed. If the target is authNoPriv, then the AuthenticationProtocol needs to be set to a value other than noAuth on the SNMPAgentMBean. For a target of authPriv, both AuthenticationProtocol and the PrivacyProtocol must be specified on the SNMPAgentMBean.
cause320948=An invalid combination of authentication and privacy protocols on the SNMPAgentMBean and security level on the SNMPTrapDestinationMBean has been configured.
action320948=Specify the valid security level for the users and the trap destinations.
messagedetail320949=The security level on the proxy configuration must be less than or equal to that of the parent SNMP agent itself. Thus, if the SNMP agent is configured with AUTH_NOPRIV, the security level of the proxy cannot be AUTH_PRIV.
cause320949=A security level on the SNMP proxy was configured that exceeds the security level of the SNMP agent that corresponds to its configured authentication and privacy protocols.
action320949=Configure a level of security on the proxy that is lower than the security level of the SNMP agent. For example, if the SNMP agent is configured with authentication but no privacy, configure the security level of NOAUTH_NOPRIV or AUTH_NOPRIV on the proxy.
messagedetail320950=The SNMP agent could not be started.
cause320950=Binding to specified UDP and agentX ports is a common problem. The ports to which the agent binds may not be available. Also, on UNIX platforms, ports up to 1023 are protected and can be bound only by processes owned by root.
action320950=Check whether the specified ports are available. On UNIX, the default UDP port (161) and master AgentX port (705) are protected to be used by processes owned by root. In that case, either start the server as root, or configure the SNMP agent to use port numbers higher than 1023.
messagedetail320951=The SNMP AgentX subagent could not be started.
cause320951=A common problem is with binding to the specified agentX port. The port to which the agent binds may not be available. Also, on UNIX platforms, ports up to 1023 are protected and can be bound only by processes owned by root.
action320951=Check whether the specified port is available. On UNIX, the default master AgentX port (705) is protected to be used by processes owned by root. In that case, either start the server as root, or configure the SNMP agent to use port numbers higher than 1023.
messagedetail320952=The SNMP Agent could not successfully send the trap or inform.
cause320952=The SNMPTrapDestination(s) could be incorrectly configured or the SNMP Manager might not be running at the configured location.
action320952=Ensure that the SNMP Manager is available at the configured SNMP TrapDestinations.
severity320953=32
messagedetail320953=The port on which the SNMP Agent is running could be different from the configured port number.
cause320953=The SNMP Agent tries to bind to the configured port. If this port is not available due to another SNMP Agent being deployed to the same machine on another WebLogic Server instance then the SNMP Agent tries to find the nearest port and binds to it.
action320953=No action is needed. The port number is also reflected in the UDPListenPort attribute of the SNMPAgentRuntimeMBean interface on this Server.
messagedetail320954=The SNMPAgent failed to initialize the extensions.
cause320954=The SNMPAgent Extension provider implementations could not be loaded successfully.
action320954=Take corrective action based on the exception details.
severity320955=64
messagedetail320955=The SNMP Agent has been shut down and is not running on the server.
cause320955=This message is for informational purposes only.
action320955=No action is required.
messagedetail320956=The trap destination is configured with an invalid host name.
cause320956=The host name specified in the SNMPTrapDestination configuraiton is not valid.
action320956=Correct the configuration and start the SNMP agent again.
messagedetail320957=Empty value for Community prefix is not valid, a value of either "public" or "private" is not secure and not allowed.
cause320957=The SNMP agent is enabled and the community prefix attribute is empty or set to either public or private.
action320957=Correct the configuration and start the SNMP agent again.
severity320958=16
messagedetail320958=Due to security concerns, the SNMP v1 or v2 protocols should not be used. The SNMP v3 protocol should be used instead.
cause320958=The SNMP agent is enabled and the configuration enables the use of SNMP v1 or SNMP v2 protocol.
action320958=Correct the configuration to only use SNMP v3 and start the SNMP agent again.
