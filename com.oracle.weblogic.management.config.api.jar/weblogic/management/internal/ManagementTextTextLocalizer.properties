STARTINSTANDBYUsage=(Deprecated) STARTINSTANDBY <targetServer>
StartInStandByDescription=(Deprecated) The starting of a server in STANDBY mode through weblogic.Admin has been deprecated. The starting of a server in a given mode is specified by configuring the StartupMode attribute of the ServerMBean. The server will be issued a START command and the StartupMode will determine in what mode the server comes up. Please note that for starting the server in STANDBY mode, the Administration Port needs to be enabled.

If subsystems do not\n\tcomplete work, WebLogic Server performs a forced shutdown on\n\tthe server instance. If you do not specify a value, the SHUTDOWN\n\tcommand defers to the Graceful Shutdown Timeout setting that is\n\tspecified on the Server->Control->Start/Stop tab of the\n\tAdministration Console. By default, this setting is 0, which means\n\tthat the server will wait indefinitely for graceful shutdown to \n\tcomplete. \n<targetServer> = The name of the server to shut down. \n<seconds> = (Deprecated) Number of seconds allowed to elapse between\n\tthe invocation of this command and the shutdown of the server. \n\tInstead of specifying a delay in the SHUTDOWN command, you\n\tcan now use the Administration Console to set attributes\n\tthat control how a server shuts down. \n<stringMessage> = (Deprecated) Message, in double quotes, that is sent\n\tif a user tries to log in while the WebLogic Server is shut\n\tdown.
ShutDownDescription=Gracefully shuts down the specified WebLogic Server instance.\nA graceful shutdown gives WebLogic Server subsystems time to complete certain application processing currently in progress.

GetStateUsage=GETSTATE [<targetServer>]
GetStateDescription=Returns the current state of a server.
GetStateSample=GETSTATE myserver
GetStateArgs=<targetServer> = The name of the server for which you want to retrieve\n\tthe current state. If you do not specify a value, the command\n\treturns the state of the server that is specified in the\n\t-url argument.
BatchDescription=Runs a sequence of weblogic.Admin commands. Using this command provides better performance than issuing a series of individual weblogic.Admin commands.
BatchSample=BATCHUPDATE -batchFile c:\\temp\\load.txt ' -continueOnError'
BatchArgs=-batchFile = The name of a text file that contains a list of\n\tweblogic.Admin commands.\n-continueOnError = If one of the commands fails or emits errors,\n\tweblogic.Admin ignores the error and continues to the next\n\tcommand. By default, weblogic.Admin stops processing commands\n\tas soon as it encounters an error. \n-batchCmdVerbose = Causes BATCHUPDATE to print each command before\n\texecuting it.
ForceSDDescription=Immediately terminates a server instance. When you initiate a forced shutdown, the server instructs subsystems to immediately drop in-work requests.
