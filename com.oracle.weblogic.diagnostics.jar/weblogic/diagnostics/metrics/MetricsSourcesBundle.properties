partition.bean.short=An expression bean that is scoped to a partition
partition.bean.displayName=Partition Expression Bean
partition.bean.full=An expression bean that is scoped to the partition in which the\n \
WLDF System Resource is deployed, and which provides a convenient short-hand\n \
for accessing MBeans related to that partition.  Note that this expression bean is only\n \
available when referenced within a WLDF Watch rule that is deployed to a Domain partition.
partition.name=The name of the partition
partition.id=The globally unique identifier associated with the named partition
partition.runtime.short=The PartitionRuntimeMBean root for the partition
partition.runtime.full=The PartitionRuntimeMBean root for the partition, where the WLDF System Resource is deployed
partition.config.short=The PartitionMBean configuration root for the partition
partition.config.full=The PartitionMBean configuration root for the partition; note that this is the read-only \n \
PartitionMBean that is registered in the ServerRuntime MBeanServer.
partition.query.short=Issues partition-scoped JMX queries, filtered by the partition name
partition.query.onPattern=A JMX ObjectName (or ObjectName pattern)  
partition.query.attributePattern=A Java EL expression for accessing a value within the set of MBeans\n \
returned in the query set

cluster.runtime.namedesc=The name of the cluster
clusterRuntime.getClusters.desc=Provides a map of beans that represent active cluster objects within the domain

domain.runtime.domainquery.desc=Executes a JMX query against a set of targets within the DomainRuntime MBeanServer
domain.runtime.targetquery.desc=Executes a JMX query against a set of targets within the DomainRuntime MBeanServer

targets.string.desc=A list of server or cluster targets as a comma-delimited String 
targets.array.desc=A list of server or cluster targets as an array of Strings, e.g., ["server1", "cluster1"]
onPattern.desc=A valid JMX <code>ObjectName</code> or <code>ObjectName</code> pattern
expression.desc=A EL expression that is used to retrieve a value on each matching MBean instance

domain.runtime.desc=An expression bean that provides access to MBeans registered in the DomainRuntime MBeanServer
domain.runtime.displayname=Domain Runtime Expression Bean
domain.runtime.serverRuntimes.desc=Returns the set of active ServerRuntimeMBean instances in the domain
domain.runtime.lookupServerRuntime.desc=Returns the ServerRuntimeMBean for the named server instance, or null if absent
domain.runtime.lookupServerRuntime.serverName=The name of the server

server.runtime.desc=An expression bean that provides access to MBeans registered in the ServerRuntime MBeanServer
server.runtime.displayname=Server Runtime Expression Bean
server.runtime.namedesc=The expression bean name
server.runtime.serverruntime.desc=The root ServerRuntimeMBean in the local ServerRuntime MBeanServer
server.runtime.domain.desc=The root DomainMBean in the local ServerRuntime MBeanServer
